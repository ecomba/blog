  <blockquote>
  <p>The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.</p>

  <p>~ Socrates</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During a coaching session today my coachee and myself talked about the importance of writing in the context of 
improving ones ability to communicate with your team in a written form.</p>

<p>In a remote world, communicating effectively has become more important than ever. A lot of newly remote companies usually
use <em>chat</em> a lot with tools like <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> amongst others. Chat is a very tempting medium; it creates
the illusion of closeness in a team.</p>

<p>The issue with chat is the ephemeral nature of the medium. It’s a great replacement of in person communication in the 
office when we don’t want (or can) to jump on a call, but it can also be very distracting when you want to concentrate
on your work.</p>

<p>Problems arise when we want to communicate ideas or request feedback for an issue we are having.</p>

<p>I prefer long form writing to chat. When I have to spend a little more time to clarify my ideas (<em>in my head and then 
in writing</em>) I tend to be able to describe much better what I want to say. 
Long form writing, by it’s very nature, has a longer shelf life as well (<em>whereas in chat, conversations get lost in time</em>).</p>

<p>Do you and your team write long form? If not, why not? What other methods do you use to keep the knowledge of your remote
team?</p>
