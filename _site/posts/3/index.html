<p>A lot of people say they are afraid of doing that thing they really would love doing. They dream about that life that could be, but never seem to be able to get the courage to do so.</p>

<p>Thing is, this is not fear. Fear comes from comes from an imminent threat or danger.</p>

<p>Anxiety happens when instead of doing something we <em>think</em> about possible (<em>bad</em>) outcomes of the thing we want to do.</p>

<p>One thing that a few know though is that your anxiety is a compass you can use to know what you should be doing. Your resistance tries to keep you away from doing things that threaten your inner status quo.</p>

<p><strong>Fight your anxieties and face your dreams!</strong></p>

  <p>There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge.</p>

  <p>~ Bertrand Russell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you find yourself, sometimes, reading or researching some seemingly pointless piece of information? Have you ever gone on a limb to find out something more about some random fact that you have overheard?</p>

<p>Or, on the other hand, do you frown upon people who do these kind of things? Do you think these are pointless exercises that are a waste of everyones time?</p>

<p><em>Useless knowledge</em> helps you to feed your curiosity and your ability to find information just about any topic you can imagine.</p>

<p>If you are a knowledge worker, a problem solver by profession, this is an excellent way to hone your skills; because <em>useless knowledge</em> is not so useless after all.</p>

  <p>“Why do so many people work so hard so they can escape to Disneyland? Why are video games more popular than work? … Why do many workers spend years dreaming about and planning for retirement?</p>

  <p>The reason is simple and dispiriting. We have made the workplace a frustrating and joyless place where people do what they’re told and have few ways to participate in decisions or fully use their talents. As a result, they naturally gravitate to pursuits in which they can exercise a measure of control over their lives.</p>

  <p>In most organisations I have been exposed to around the world, … we still have the offices “above” the working people … who, without consulting workers, make decisions that dramatically affect their lives.</p>

  <p>~ Dennis Bakke</p>

<p>Stop playing video games to escape your reality! Stop trying to control the little things that don’t really count to much in your life.</p>

<p>You are exceptional and incredibly capable of doing what you should be doing.</p>

<p>Things need to change,</p>

<p><strong>we need to regain control of our <em>self</em>!</strong></p>

  <p>Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains</p>

  <p>~ Jean-Jacques Rousseau</p>

<p>There are chains in our society, in the pressure of living in a society. Some of them can be broken with courage and determination, some are harder to go through.</p>

<p>Breaking free of chains requires courage. The smallest chain, made of the weakest material can seem daunting at first. What is an impossible task at first might be really easy to master once you can see past your own anxiety.</p>

<p><strong>Your chains can be broken – <em>only if you will</em>!</strong></p>

  <p>Anybody can become angry – that is easy, but to be angry
with the right person and to the right degree and at the
right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way –
that is not within everybody’s power and is not easy.</p>

  <p>~ Aristotle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Curiosity drives the minds of the human nature. We seek and seek to understand. Sometimes we ask questions when we don’t understand something, sometimes we show the world what we have found or what we have – within the limits of our own perception – witnessed.</p>

<p>With the rise of the <em>Social Media</em> this has been multiplied to a great extent. What someone said in one remote corner of the world is oftentimes discussed in a complete different corner of the world.</p>

<p>It incredible beautiful and empowering how we can make our world shrink and bring us all together.</p>

<p>Sadly though, this is not the only thing happening. Every comment is directed, every opinion turned over. The curious get shot down with angry comments, the opinions of others assaulted.</p>

<p>The web we have created is turning into an hostile place to be in. There is a lot of anger in the world. I am no one to tell you to change, but next time you want to give an off response to someone try to sit back, think again about the context and relax a moment.</p>

<p><em>There is no need to be insulting strangers all over the world just because they are not standing in front of you.</em></p>
