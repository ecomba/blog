          <p>So <a href="/2014/08/25/100-days/">yesterday I announced</a> the idea <a href="http://roidriscoll.github.io">Roi</a> and me had about committing every day to <a href="http://github.com">github</a>.</p>

<p>Today I set up a new project, <a href="https://github.com/ecomba/chronicler">chronicler</a> to start working on it for some time.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ecomba/chronicler">Chronicler</a> is a blogging service that will focus on the content creation and ease of use. I want non-technical bloggers not to have to worry about anything but their content.</p>

<p>The code will be open source, but I will add a service as well for those who don’t want to deal with the technicalities of setting a chronicler instance up ( <em>big words… I haven’t even really started with the project and I am talking about these things already</em> ).</p>

<p>Wish me luck with it and if you like the idea ( <em>once you see a little more of code in the project repo</em> ) maybe you can chip in and help?</p>

<p>So my friend <a href="http://roidriscoll.github.io">Roi</a> and me have started this thing… a <a href="http://roidriscoll.github.io/blog/2014/08/25/100-days/">100 days</a> of creating content, or rather a 100 days of pushing code to <a href="http://github.com">github</a>.</p>

<p>Coding is a passion of mine, but recently I have been working mostly on private projects and repos, which is great, but we want to produce things that are useful for people as well.</p>

<p>There are a ton of projects and ideas that one can build to help, and I am going to start working on some.</p>

<p>I am thinking about a blogging engine that I thought about a while ago, but never got to work on as I somehow had the idea of it being a commercial product ( <em>also I wanted to use it myself for blogging, maybe I will, maybe I will just create it and let others do it</em> ). This might be a good starting project, I will see. <strong>The important part is working on something, <em>many different things</em>, to create the habit</strong>.</p>

<p>Wish us luck and, <strong>hey</strong> if you have an idea that you don’t mind to be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source project</a>, just let us know!</p>

          <p>Usually I keep <em>dot</em> and configuration files somehow on <a href="http://github.com">github</a> so that I can retrieve them in case of a mayor disaster ( <em>laptop blowing up, etc</em> ).</p>

<p>The other day I was pairing with a friend. I decided I wanted to share with him my remote pairing configuration…</p>

<p><strong>WTF!!! WHERE DID IT GO?!?!?</strong></p>

<p>Not to long ago my trusted <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> stopped working and I changed it for a <a href="http://makersacademy.com">Makers Academy</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">MackBook Pro</a> ( <em>a really nice machine if you ask me</em> ). Given that I am not working remotely at the moment I didn’t have any <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net">tmux</a> or my trusted configurations setup… <em>a real bummer</em></p>

<p>So I quickly installed it and went through it with him, but having learned the lesson, I added it to <a href="http://github.com/ecomba">my github</a> for future reference.</p>

<p>If you are remotely interested in my <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net">tmux</a> configuration you can take a look at it <strong><a href="http://github.com/ecomba/tmux-conf">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Yesterday we had a wonderful <em>Talks Night (tm)</em> at <a href="http://makersacademy.com">Makers Academy</a>! If you haven’t ever been to a <strong>Makers Academy Talks Night</strong>  and you happen to be a student at our academy, you definitely should!</p>

<p>In a <strong>Makers Academy Talks Night</strong> you will learn a lot of things that you possibly didn’t know about, like how to produce music, how to save money by batch-cooking, Venezuela, Singapore, women in tech, … <strong>you name it</strong> It is a really great evening and the kudos really go to all the students, but specially to those who had the courage to stand in front of everyone giving a talk!</p>

<p>I wanted to write a little about this concept, I have been talking about a little for the last five years or so, as I gave a talk about it during our <strong>Makers Academy Talks Night</strong> yesterday; <strong><a href="/talks/mushin-no-shin">Mushin no shin</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Your brain does many things to cope, specially when under perceived stress conditions (<em>learning in a bootcamp counts as such</em>), it might default to <strong>fear</strong> (<em>or rather anxiety</em>), <strong>anger</strong> or <strong>ego</strong>. These are all natural emotions that we all experience in our lifetimes (<em>sometimes even multiple times a day</em>). The problem with all of them is that they will not help you in those situations that require your full attention.</p>

<p>Your mind is troubled and there is a lot of chatter that does not allow you to react to the situation at hand as you are to busy inside your emotional state. <em>Mushin no shin</em>, or the mind that is no mind is a state in which your mind is not fixed or busy with thought or emotion, but rather open to everything. It is an ideal mind state in which you can absorb knowledge at incredible speed.</p>

<p><em>It is a difficult state of mind to achieve and to keep, but as everything we do, it’s not about how easy it is, but how much we invest in it for our own sake.</em></p>
