  <p>Think twice before you speak, because your words and influence 
will plant the seed of either success of failure in the mind
of another</p>

  <p>~ Napoleon Hill</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your mind can be influenced very easily – words we say to others can prime them to fail or do great.</p>

<p><em>It’s quite remarkable how we are wired.</em></p>

<p>Next time you feel a certain way (<em>anxious, amazing, etc</em>) spend some time thinking why that is. Did you or someone else say something that made you feel that way?</p>

<p><strong>There is power in words, use them wisely!</strong></p>

  <p>Trust is the glue of life. It’s the most essential ingredient

  <p>~ Stephen Covey</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Do you trust the people you work with?</strong></p>

<p>Don’t just go and and answer <em>”yes”</em>. Think about it first. And besides, no one is going to hear your answer anyways.</p>

<p>What does it mean to <strong>really</strong> trust someone?</p>

<p>They are the people you know that will do anything in their hands to help you with whatever problem you have; they are rare.</p>

<p>In the work environment you will possibly not achieve this level of trust I am talking about, but you will definitely know if you don’t trust someone.</p>

<p>If you don’t trust the people you work with find someone you do trust – you will enjoy work and your life far more.</p>

<p><strong>Trust me on that!</strong></p>

<p>Zombies walk our streets day in and day out. People with their heads buried in their mobile phones, day dreaming or simply just sleeping whilst they are walking to work.</p>

<p>It shocks me every time when I come to this realisation as I dodge people on the streets…</p>

<p>You are not aware of your surroundings, you live inside your on shell disregarding anyone and everyone.</p>

<p>If everyone would try to be a little more aware and try not to step on every others toes (<em>figuratively and not so figuratively</em>) everything would be so much better for all.</p>

  <p>Being at ease with not knowing is crucial for answers to come
to you.</p>

  <p>~ Eckhart Tolle</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being at ease is easier said than done. It’s the feeling of feeling comfortable in your own skin; no matter where you are (<em>work, with friends, etc</em>).</p>

<p>It’s something so simple and yet so difficult to achieve, there are people we feel we need to please, the social pressure…</p>

<p>The question is, <strong>why do you think you have to please anyone?</strong> The only person that really matters in your life is <strong>you</strong>. You have to live with yourself for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Being at ease, finding comfort in who you are, is possibly the first (<em>and possibly only</em>) step you should take in your daily interaction with people.</p>

          <p>People like the late Steve Jobs where known for their incredible ability to develop a laser sharp focus when it came to work.</p>

<p>Mastery in a skill takes a lifetime of dedication and perfection. You need to practice day in and day out honing the skill.</p>

<p>The problem comes when the skill you practice is the only thing you practice. As a developer you need to hone a whole array of skills ranging from a notion of design, business, marketing, human empathy, etc.</p>

<p>Coding, alas the one you will focus the most in, should not be your only skill.</p>

<p><strong>Your focus should lie on being an all-round better person.</strong></p>
