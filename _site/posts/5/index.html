          <p>The way we perceive companies from the outside varies. Most look like a thing, a faceless corporation that offers a product or a service – <em>a tribe</em>.</p>

<p>How the company is perceived within; that’s a more interesting question.</p>

<p>Sadly I see a lot of places in where people are completely disengaged by their work or company. They are there because it pays the bills.</p>

<p>In other companies there is the will to do meaningful work, but somehow “<em>the company</em>” is making it hard.</p>

<p>Either way, that concept of a company, in the smaller scale, is obsolete.</p>

<p><strong>You should strive to work in a place that gives your work meaning, a place where you can express yourself!</strong></p>

<p>How would you define happiness? Can you imagine the most happy day in your life?</p>

<p>It might look something like this.</p>

<p><em>You wake up in the morning energised. You go for a run with your partner and then, after a romantic shower together you have a beautiful breakfast. Then you go out to some nice market to find nice new things or pursue a hobby followed by great food and other pleasantries of life.</em></p>

<p>Some would say a day like that (<em>or a variation of that</em>) would be a happy day.</p>

<p>But the day could equally look more like a hard grind as you are trying to help people in need, sweating, cursing, getting dirty as you do your best to make the lives of others better. At the end of that day you’d feel a sense of accomplishment that would make you feel happy.</p>

<p>I love helping others. It makes me happy to see that I could better the life of someone (<em>even if it’s just a marginal betterment</em>).</p>

<p>When was the last time you did help someone even though you could have done something different that day?</p>

<p><strong>I love the world we are living in!</strong></p>

<p>When I was younger people were judged (<em>and got their great reputation</em>) by their titles and what they had studied. If you had a doctor title, were a professor or anything alike <strong>you were someone</strong>.</p>

<p>The world has changed though. A title proves you knew how to pass a test; you mastered the ability to keep your head down and to all the things needed to earn it.</p>

<p>People are judged by the value they bring to others, by what they do and how they are able to make the lives of others better than they were before they met.</p>

<p>You are what you can do, not who you say you are.</p>

<p><em>What can <strong>you</strong> do? How will you <strong>improve my life</strong> if we meet?</em></p>

<p>The city is loud. There is an incessant cacophony all around us; the soundtrack of our metropolitan lives. Some of us cover the sound with yet more sound – silence, <strong>where is it gone?</strong></p>

<p><em>Today when I woke up I decided not to open my eyes at first. I was just letting my senses discover my surroundings. First the sounds of the busy street I live in outside of my bedroom, the warm embrace of my duvet and finally the light shining through the window blind.</em></p>

<p>I miss the silence, not the total absence of sound, but the sound of nature; far away from the madness of a city.</p>

<p>When was the last time you experienced a whole day of silence?</p>
