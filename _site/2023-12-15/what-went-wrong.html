<p>Do you remember when you first came into contact with agile software development?</p>

<p>For me, it was somewhat in the late 90’s. I remember that time fondly. We worked in a high-stakes environment, creating software for Germany’s first online insurance company. We were experiencing high pressure, and the stakes for our clients for such a disruptive product were even higher.</p>

<p>As one of the technical leads in our team, I was feeling the pressure; it was almost unbearable; something had to change.</p>

<p>That’s when I came across the <a href="http://c2.com">c2 wiki</a>. I spent so much time absorbing the knowledge embedded in those pages; it changed me.</p>

<p>Agile has always meant to be a change in your inner values, a joyful way of working, and ultimately focusing primarily on shipping software that matters.</p>

<p>Over the last decade(s), there has been a tendency to focus on rituals and team topology practices, which, if dissected, don’t add to the company’s bottom line in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>Are you overcomplicating your processes and teams? Is your software being shipped consistently?</p>
