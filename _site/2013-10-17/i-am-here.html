<p>Finally I got my new blogging engine <a href="http://ghost.org">ghost</a> up and 
running. I pretended to have a more <em>dramatic</em> blog entry as my first one, 
but to be honest I am so excited about having this thing working and running 
after I have put in so much effort into it the last couple of days that I 
just needed to get something out.</p>

<p>Anyhow, in the (<em>hopefully</em> near) future I will post my ideas and thoughts 
about many software related (and unrelated) things…</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>

<p>E!</p>
