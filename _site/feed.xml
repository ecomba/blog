<p>Since I was a little boy, I’ve been surrounded by technology, it all started when I was ten years old, and I got my first computer. It was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_32/64">old machine</a> without any games, so I was forced to learn how to program. I soon became enamoured with technology and programming languages; I was fascinated by the worlds and possibilities I suddenly had at my fingertips.</p>

<p>Over time though, I lost my drive to program, <em>just for programming’s sake</em> and always looked for meaning: <em>“Why are we doing this?”, “What’s the purpose of this application?”, “Who will it help?”</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bread_small.jpg" alt="image-right" class="align-right" />And then it changed yet again; even though I am surrounded by technology (<em>not just by the nature of my work, but all sorts of gadgets as well</em>), I love the simpler things in life. I love baking bread, cooking jam and marmalade, and preparing dishes with fresh ingredients daily.</p>

<p>My home is a mixture of new and old, juxtaposing times, and I would not have it any other way.</p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all have rosy memories of a simpler, happy time- a time of homemade apple pie and gingham curtains, a time when Mom understood everything and Dad could fix anything. “Let’s get those traditional family values back!” we murmur to each other.

<p>It’s been like a few lifetimes since I blogged in here. To be fair, I nearly forgot that I had this little blog. How are you? Has life treated you well?</p>

<p>I’ve had so many different adventures since I last posted here; they are to many to tell, but I might come back to tell you some at a later stage.</p>

<p>I am older now. Not sure I am wiser. Things are different and yet the same. I still want to help others with my work and still smile at the rising sun in the mornings.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/beanmind_logo_small.png" alt="image-left" class="align-left" /> My newest (ad)venture is called <a href="https://beanmind.com">Bean Mind</a>. Bean Mind’s purpose is helping the coffee roasting businesses work more efficiently. Even though people have been drinking coffee for ages, the speciality coffee roasting business is relatively young and processes are still in the making.

  <p>Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness.

<p>Recently someone sent me this poem from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C.S.Lewis</a>. When I first read it I felt uneasy about it. I could not understand the point of the poem. And then I saw the reason…</p>

<p>For Lewis love means opening our hearts to pain and sorrow. He sees the vulnerability of love as something negative, something to be avoided. Being vulnerable is the whole point of loving!</p>

<p>Loving, truly loving, is a deep connection in which you put yourself out in the open.</p>

<p><strong>The only alternative is to live without love; to be alone forever.</strong></p>

<p><em>Deep down though everyone of us knows that we were not born to be alone, everyone seeks connection.</em></p>

<p>This poem made me reflect on my work though. Over the years I have always tried to work for clients I can relate to, clients that at some level I had a connection to. People I could be vulnerable around and give them my true self. Only that way I am  capable of doing honest work, provide the best service money can buy.</p>

<p>If I’d hide my vulnerability away I would become a soulless creature in my emotional life and a worse professional for it.</p>

<p><strong>I reject that life that is no life!</strong></p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken.

<p>The increasing amount of negativity in the world is mind boggling to me. Yes there are issues, yes, we all have to fix them <strong>together</strong>.</p>

<p>But there are two approaches to this, you can either insult, patronise, be rude, etc., or you can choose to be polite, understanding, empathic.</p>

<p>Yes, I am a privileged white man (<em>words someone used to attack me on the internet</em>), but I choose to use my privilege to help others. If you insult me, try to burn me, I will turn my back to you, continue doing what I am doing helping the world becoming a better place, while you keep on shouting and using your angry ways.</p>

<p>The only thing I ask you, as an intelligent human being, to <strong>stop being a jerk on the internet!</strong> Being far away, protected by the intimacy of your home, does not give you the right to insult others back and forth.</p>

<p>There is a good remedy for this, if you are interested:</p>

<p><em>Get out of your house (and your head), step outside, look at the world in wonder, and start helping others (and living your life).</em></p>

<p>And if you happen to be less privileged, seek help from people that will honestly look after you and offer real help, not just some way for them to feel better about themselves.</p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We focus so much on our differences, and that is creating, I think, a lot of chaos and negativity and bullying in the world.

<p>There is a difference between dreaming and having a goal.</p>

<p>I dream every day about great deeds and adventures in foreign lands of wonder and magic, places that don’t exist or are buried back in time.</p>

<p>I also dream about things that I don’t really want to do, but I think it would be a great idea if I did – I just don’t want to do these hard enough to put in the effort.</p>

<p>Sometimes though I have a goal – I set a target and I work towards that goal every time I get a chance to do so (<em>depending how eager I am to get there I will spend more time on it</em>).</p>
