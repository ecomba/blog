  <p>You cannot spend your way out of recession or borrow your way out of debt.</p>

  <p>~ Daniel Hannan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, while hanging out in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>
(<em>as I do when I am having my morning coffee</em>), I came across a post from <a href="https://ronjeffries.com" target="_blank">Ron Jeffries</a>
(<em>and <a href="http://c2.com" target="blank">Ward Cunningham’s</a> answer to it – there were more people commenting though</em>).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ron-ward-masto.jpg" width="45%" /></p>

<p>Many teams I work with usually blame the state of their codebase to Technical Debt. This usually leads to a group
discussion, where I try to understand their current state and their desired state for their codebase. During these
discussions it’s important to actively listen to the teams and understand their particular context.</p>

<p>What I usually find is that there is a misunderstanding of what Technical Debt really is; or rather, how Ward coined the
concept when he did back in the early 1990s.</p>

<h2 id="the-origins-of-technical-debt">The Origins of Technical Debt</h2>

<p>Ward introduced the concept of technical debt in the early 1990s. He used the metaphor of technical debt to explain how developers sometimes take shortcuts to meet deadlines, with the understanding that they will have to come back later to clean up the code.</p>

<p>Ward’s initial analogy compared the debt incurred by developers to financial debt. Just as financial debt can be a useful tool for growth if managed properly, technical debt can be a strategic decision in software development. However, if not managed carefully, both types of debt can lead to significant problems.</p>

<h3 id="deliberate-technical-debt">Deliberate Technical Debt</h3>

<p>Wards’ analogy describes when a team knowingly takes on technical debt, often to meet a tight deadline or to quickly test a new feature.
The team is aware of the trade-offs and plans to address the debt later. It is, in its essence, a strategy to meet the
business demands in the short term, with an action plan for repayment.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sadly, in most teams, this is not the case.</em></strong></p>

<p>Most teams treat Technical Debt as <strong><em>Accidental Debt</em></strong>, the unintentional debt, often due to lack of knowledge, 
experience, or poor practices. This can be particularly dangerous because it often goes unnoticed until it causes significant problems.</p>

<p>Other times we find that over time, as new features are added to a codebase, it can become less coherent and harder to maintain. 
This gradual decline is often referred to as <strong><em>Bit Rot</em></strong>.</p>

<p>If you look closely at Wards reply to Ron on Mastodon, it is clear that in his view Accidental Debt and Bit Rot where 
never part of the Technical Debt metaphor (<em>as coined by him</em>).</p>

<p><strong><em>Accidental Debt and Bit Rot are a state you find yourself in and not a business strategy.</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="the-cost-of-ignoring-technical-debt">The Cost of Ignoring Technical Debt</h2>

<p>Technical debt, like financial debt, carries interest. 
If technical debt is not addressed, the cost of maintaining and extending the codebase increases over time.</p>

<p>This “interest” can take many forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Increased complexity</strong>: As the codebase becomes more tangled, developers spend more time understanding and navigating the code, which slows down development.</li>
  <li><strong>More bugs</strong>: Quick fixes and shortcuts often introduce new bugs, leading to more time spent on debugging and troubleshooting.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced agility</strong>: A codebase burdened with technical debt is harder to modify, making it difficult to respond quickly to new requirements or changes in the market.</li>
</ul>

<p>If technical debt is ignored for too long, the cost of addressing it can become overwhelming, leading to a situation 
where the development team is stuck in a cycle of “paying off the interest” without ever making progress.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-manage-technical-debt">How do you manage technical debt?</h2>

<p>The key is not to avoid technical debt altogether but to manage it wisely.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first step is to be transparent about the technical decisions you take as a team and the dept you might be incurring.</li>
  <li>Not all technical debt needs to be paid off immediately. Teams should prioritize which debt is most critical to address based on factors like its impact on the codebase and the project’s long-term goals.</li>
  <li>Regular refactoring as a way to pay down technical debt incrementally. By continuously improving the codebase, teams can prevent debt from accumulating to unmanageable levels.</li>
  <li>One of the biggest challenges in managing technical debt is getting buy-in from stakeholders. Educating non-technical stakeholders about the concept of technical debt and the long-term benefits of addressing it will go a long way. It also helps to keep the discussions about technical decisions open and bring the non-technical team members into the fold.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Ultimately, the goal is not to avoid technical debt entirely, but to make sure it is a conscious, well-managed part of the development process.</em></strong></p>

<p>This year I started working, mostly as a hobby (<em>for the moment</em>) on a product management tool for companies using the
<a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> methodology.</p>

<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a> in a few companies now and I really appreciate how this 
method of working changes the way you think and operate as you work on your product.</p>

<p>It’s hard to pinpoint what it really is, it’s a sense of calm (and yet there are definite deadlines to be met), the
freedom of choice when building, and generally speaking the maturity it requires from the team you get as you work.</p>

<p>I’m trying to write more about it (<em>and the building of the product</em>) on a <a href="https://shapeup.work">separate blog</a>.

  <p>The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new.</p>

  <p>~ Socrates</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During a coaching session today my coachee and myself talked about the importance of writing in the context of 
improving ones ability to communicate with your team in a written form.</p>

<p>In a remote world, communicating effectively has become more important than ever. A lot of newly remote companies usually
use <em>chat</em> a lot with tools like <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> amongst others. Chat is a very tempting medium; it creates
the illusion of closeness in a team.</p>

<p>The issue with chat is the ephemeral nature of the medium. It’s a great replacement of in person communication in the 
office when we don’t want (or can) to jump on a call, but it can also be very distracting when you want to concentrate
on your work.</p>

<p>Problems arise when we want to communicate ideas or request feedback for an issue we are having.</p>

<p>I prefer long form writing to chat. When I have to spend a little more time to clarify my ideas (<em>in my head and then 
in writing</em>) I tend to be able to describe much better what I want to say. 
Long form writing, by it’s very nature, has a longer shelf life as well (<em>whereas in chat, conversations get lost in time</em>).</p>

<p>Do you and your team write long form? If not, why not? What other methods do you use to keep the knowledge of your remote
team?</p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name><email>hello@ecomba.pro</email></author><category term="musings" /><category term="feedback" /><category term="coaching" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new. ~ Socrates]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Practice and Preparation</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023-12-28/practice-and-preparation" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Practice and Preparation" /><published>2023-12-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-12-28T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023-12-28/practice-and-preparation</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023-12-28/practice-and-preparation"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>Agility requires practice and preparation.</p>

  <p>~ Joshua Kerievsky, <a href="https://joyofagility.com">Joy of Agility</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>During my Christmas break, I am catching up with my reading, spending time reading the books I had set aside a while ago.</p>

<p>One of these books is <a href="https://joyofagility.com"><strong>Joy of Agility</strong></a> by <a href="https://www.industriallogic.com/people/joshua/">Joshua Kerievsky</a>. Having worked with Joshua a few years ago, I was thrilled to see him release this book after all the great work he’s been doing with <a href="https://modernagile.org">Modern Agile</a>.</p>

<p>I’m not going to talk about his book just yet (I’ll leave that review to when I finish reading it), but I wanted to highlight this quote as it resonated with me and the way I feel about agility.</p>

<p>Many people think that being agile is <em>just</em> following a set of practices.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>”If we follow these practices dictated by method <strong>S</strong> we will succeed in being <strong>A</strong>gile” (<em>or so the mantra goes</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth; agile is much more than a set of practices, but that’s for another day…</p>

<p>Being agile requires you to be good at what you do. You practice daily when your skills are needed to perform without overthinking about it.</p>

<p>Years ago, I was giving a class on <a href="https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/evolutionary-design/"><em>Evolutionary design</em></a> when one of the students told me that this way of working didn’t make much sense unless you know what you want at the end. I asked them what they meant by that. It turns out they didn’t trust their skills and intuition to take them on a journey to explore and code their design as it came along.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lack of (<em>coding</em>) practice was a barrier to entry for this technique.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This happens with other methods, too; they feel awkward to start, and you will always feel challenged when trying them out without training.</p>

<p>Do you need help with any agile techniques you want to use at your workplace?</p>

  <p>Christmas, children, is not a date. It is a state of mind.</p>

  <p>~ Mary Ellen Chase</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a strange time for me, especially this year. During Christmas time, people in the West celebrate some religious dates most of us don’t believe in. And yet, it’s somewhat magical; we come together, sit at a table and enjoy our company.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, the 24th of December was magical. We, the kids, would decorate the tree while my mother would spend almost all day in the kitchen preparing cookies and dinner for the evening.</p>

<p>Then, when the time was right, in the evening, we would be playing in my sisters’ room (<em>it was the furthest from the living room</em>). My mother would take the presents from their hiding place and put them under the tree while we played. Then she would play the Christmas bells from the Austrian Choir on our stereo in the living room at full pelt, and, we kids would run, laughing to the living room finding the tree and living room lit up, the smell of pine in the air. It was a magical moment for us, in which Santa had become real and had left presents for us.</p>

<p><strong>I love the memories of that time.</strong></p>

<p>And yet, I haven’t been able to recreate this for future generations in my adult life. Life has taken me on so many adventures (far and wide) and never allowed me to create that magical moment, so I eventually stopped celebrating it.</p>

<p>This year, I feel even less inclined to celebrate (<em>is that even possible?</em>), yet some personal circumstances have given me a little stab to make tonight special for someones who deserve a magical moment in their lives.</p>

<p>I’m working on preparing some courses for 2024. While doing so, I’m also looking at what’s available in the market.</p>

<p>Most courses lack a thorough syllabus or the amount of time needed to absorb the knowledge to be prepared for the task the course is setting (or equipping) you to do. Some of them offer hands-on training, but many are just classroom-type classes.</p>

<p>The first course I’ll be releasing (<em>hopefully soon</em>) is directed to <em>agile coaches</em> who are either about to start or with just a little time under their belts and want to improve their skills.</p>

<p>It won’t give you a world-renowned certificate (<em>although I can create a certificate for you if you so desire</em>), but it will prepare you for the task at hand.</p>

<p>One thing I’m also toying with is the availability of myself after you’ve completed the course. Many times, when we learn a new skill, once we’ve learned it, we are left alone to deal with our newly acquired knowledge; I want to change that (<em>not sure how I will make that happen yet though</em>)!</p>

<p>Many companies these days claim to “<em>be agile</em>”; the reason is pretty simple: they have adopted some of the practices defined long ago in the “<em>agile manifesto</em>”.</p>

<p>The funny thing about this is that the practices are the <strong>easiest</strong> part of “<em>being agile</em>”.</p>

<p>Practices help to be agile; they are little crutches you use to acclimate to the new shift in perspective. The real benefit of agility is, interestingly enough, embedded in part in the very word: “<strong>agile</strong>”.</p>

<p>The values a company and its people adhere to dictate directly how adaptable to change they are or, controversially, how calcified they’ve become.</p>

<p>Do you remember when you first came into contact with agile software development?</p>

<p>For me, it was somewhat in the late 90’s. I remember that time fondly. We worked in a high-stakes environment, creating software for Germany’s first online insurance company. We were experiencing high pressure, and the stakes for our clients for such a disruptive product were even higher.</p>

<p>As one of the technical leads in our team, I was feeling the pressure; it was almost unbearable; something had to change.</p>

<p>That’s when I came across the <a href="http://c2.com">c2 wiki</a>. I spent so much time absorbing the knowledge embedded in those pages; it changed me.</p>

<p>Agile has always meant to be a change in your inner values, a joyful way of working, and ultimately focusing primarily on shipping software that matters.</p>

<p>Over the last decade(s), there has been a tendency to focus on rituals and team topology practices, which, if dissected, don’t add to the company’s bottom line in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>Are you overcomplicating your processes and teams? Is your software being shipped consistently?</p>

<p>I had a lovely catch-up with an old friend and fellow coach yesterday. We shared our life stories and what we’ve been up to up until now.</p>

<p><strong>Inevitably, we talked about our work as coaches.</strong></p>

<p>One thing that stood out for me is how there is a belief, in some communities and companies, that a coach is some tree-hugging, hippy person (<em>I have in no way or form anything against people focusing on these parts of the human experience</em>) focusing on intangibles that are way off the business’s primary focus.</p>

<p>Coaching a business, a team, or a person in a working environment has (<em>or, at the very minimum, should have</em>) measurable outcomes which will improve some key operating strategy for the company (<em>what, in detail, depends on the engagement</em>). Anything else is just a <em>” feel-good experience”</em> for the team (there is value in that too).</p>

<p><strong>What kind of coach do you need?</strong></p>

<p>You read that title right, “<em>Anga!</em>”. It reminded me of a short video clip from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harvey">Steve Harvey</a>, where he mocked someone for pronouncing the word “anger” as “anga”.</p>

<p>Recently, a business partner of mine wrote an email to a renowned person in some industry, asking them for advice.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, he received an answer that differed from what he expected. The reply was full of anger and frustration, to the point my business partner replied apologising for having caused any distress (<em>he still did not know where this was coming from</em>) and explaining more about what he was after.</p>

<p>This event prompted a conversation between us partners.</p>

<p>Here is my take on replying to unsolicited emails:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t reply in anger (<em>even if the mail made you angry for some unknown reason</em>).</li>
  <li>Instead, wait till it passes or don’t reply at all.</li>
  <li>Always be polite.</li>
  <li>If you are not interested in what the other person is offering, let them know (<em>politely</em>).</li>
  <li>It’s always better to reply than to keep silent (<em>you know how you feel when someone doesn’t answer your emails, calls, messages, etc.</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wonder how the story with the angry mailer ended, he apologised (<em>in his way</em>) and clarified where he was coming from… which could be a different blog post, so I’m leaving that for tomorrow…</p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name><email>hello@ecomba.pro</email></author><category term="musings" /><category term="emotions" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speak when you are angry, and you will make the best speech you will ever regret. ~ Ambrose Bierce]]></summary></entry></feed>
