  <p>Speak when you are angry, and you will make the best speech you will ever regret.</p>

  <p>~ Ambrose Bierce</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You read that title right, “<em>Anga!</em>”. It reminded me of a short video clip from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harvey">Steve Harvey</a>, where he mocked someone for pronouncing the word “anger” as “anga”.</p>

<p>Recently, a business partner of mine wrote an email to a renowned person in some industry, asking them for advice.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, he received an answer that differed from what he expected. The reply was full of anger and frustration, to the point my business partner replied apologising for having caused any distress (<em>he still did not know where this was coming from</em>) and explaining more about what he was after.</p>

<p>This event prompted a conversation between us partners.</p>

<p>Here is my take on replying to unsolicited emails:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t reply in anger (<em>even if the mail made you angry for some unknown reason</em>).</li>
  <li>Instead, wait till it passes or don’t reply at all.</li>
  <li>Always be polite.</li>
  <li>If you are not interested in what the other person is offering, let them know (<em>politely</em>).</li>
  <li>It’s always better to reply than to keep silent (<em>you know how you feel when someone doesn’t answer your emails, calls, messages, etc.</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wonder how the story with the angry mailer ended, he apologised (<em>in his way</em>) and clarified where he was coming from… which could be a different blog post, so I’m leaving that for tomorrow…</p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name><email>hello@ecomba.pro</email></author><category term="musings" /><category term="emotions" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speak when you are angry, and you will make the best speech you will ever regret. ~ Ambrose Bierce]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“A better team”</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023-12-12/a-better-team" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="“A better team”" /><published>2023-12-12T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-12-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023-12-12/a-better-team</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023-12-12/a-better-team"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last ten years (<em>way more, but who’s counting 😅</em>), I’ve been thinking about a tool to help agile coaches and teams without a coach.</p>

<p>I had this problem a while ago when I started coaching and got my first few clients; <em>“How do I keep organised?”</em>, <em>“How do I share insights or activities with the teams?”</em></p>

<p>I always ended up using a mixture of different tools to keep myself organised. The problem with that (<em>at least for me</em>) is that I end up misplacing important information, missing key insights (<em>or spending too much time studying my notes</em>), making me work harder than I could.</p>

<p>A few years back, <a href="https://twitter.com/sbastn">Sebastian Hermida</a> created an excellent (and free) tool based on <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com">James Shores’</a> “Agile Self Assessment Quiz” (from the first edition of his book “<a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2">The Art of Agile Software Development</a>”).</p>

<p>Since then, though, it’s offline 😞.</p>

<p>Talking to Sebastian (<em>this is now about three years ago</em>), I asked him if I could use the name of the original domain he used as I wanted to create tools around agile coaching and helping teams get coaching. He gave me the green light to do whatever I liked with that domain.</p>

<p>So, now we are at the end of 2023, and my tool isn’t there yet, but I’ve got some renewed strength, and I’m seriously thinking of making this happen and scratching that old itch I have.</p>

<p><strong>Are you an agile coach?</strong> <strong>Are you in a team that needs coaching?</strong></p>

<p>Recently I’ve been feeling low in physical energy. My mental energy levels are really high
and I am constantly hustling, but I’ve noticed how my body is not responding the way I would like to.</p>

<p>Afternoon naps (<em>after lunch</em>) have become a must and my breaks are more often then they used to be.</p>

  <p>Most people who work for themselves have achieved work-life imbalance.</p>

  <p>~ Mokokoma Mokhonoana</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you start a new venture, you dream of the times when work is abundant and you reap what you have sowed.</p>

<p>To get there, though, requires an incredible push and work (<em>unless you are one of the lucky ones who’ve found something so easy to attract customers, which hardly requires any work</em>). During this time, we often forget ourselves and put our health at peril. I should know about this; I do it all the time.</p>

<p>Last month I put my gym membership on hold to spend more time working on our product at <a href="https://beanmind.com">Bean Mind</a>. The product has enjoyed a significant push towards our MVP, but the cost has been quite steep. I feel less energised and need more breaks during the day. The good news is that I was reminded how important it is to get my work-life imbalance straight.</p>

<p>It’s important not to forget that without good health, we wouldn’t be able to accomplish so many dreams we would love to.</p>

<p>Not everything is lost; this past month has taught me to get on with it, go to the gym, and work smarter! 💪🏽</p>

<p>Since I was a little boy, I’ve been surrounded by technology, it all started when I was ten years old, and I got my first computer. It was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_32/64">old machine</a> without any games, so I was forced to learn how to program. I soon became enamoured with technology and programming languages; I was fascinated by the worlds and possibilities I suddenly had at my fingertips.</p>

<p>Over time though, I lost my drive to program, <em>just for programming’s sake</em> and always looked for meaning: <em>“Why are we doing this?”, “What’s the purpose of this application?”, “Who will it help?”</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bread_small.jpg" alt="image-right" class="align-right" />And then it changed yet again; even though I am surrounded by technology (<em>not just by the nature of my work, but all sorts of gadgets as well</em>), I love the simpler things in life. I love baking bread, cooking jam and marmalade, and preparing dishes with fresh ingredients daily.</p>

<p>My home is a mixture of new and old, juxtaposing times, and I would not have it any other way.</p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name><email>hello@ecomba.pro</email></author><category term="past" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all have rosy memories of a simpler, happy time- a time of homemade apple pie and gingham curtains, a time when Mom understood everything and Dad could fix anything. “Let’s get those traditional family values back!” we murmur to each other.

<p>I’ve had so many different adventures since I last posted here; they are to many to tell, but I might come back to tell you some at a later stage.</p>

<p>I am older now. Not sure I am wiser. Things are different and yet the same. I still want to help others with my work and still smile at the rising sun in the mornings.</p>

  <p>Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.</p>

<p>Recently someone sent me this poem from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C.S.Lewis</a>. When I first read it I felt uneasy about it. I could not understand the point of the poem. And then I saw the reason…</p>

<p>For Lewis love means opening our hearts to pain and sorrow. He sees the vulnerability of love as something negative, something to be avoided. Being vulnerable is the whole point of loving!</p>

<p>Loving, truly loving, is a deep connection in which you put yourself out in the open.</p>

<p><strong>The only alternative is to live without love; to be alone forever.</strong></p>

<p><em>Deep down though everyone of us knows that we were not born to be alone, everyone seeks connection.</em></p>

<p>This poem made me reflect on my work though. Over the years I have always tried to work for clients I can relate to, clients that at some level I had a connection to. People I could be vulnerable around and give them my true self. Only that way I am  capable of doing honest work, provide the best service money can buy.</p>

<p>If I’d hide my vulnerability away I would become a soulless creature in my emotional life and a worse professional for it.</p>

<p><strong>I reject that life that is no life!</strong></p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name><email>hello@ecomba.pro</email></author><category term="love" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable. ~ C.S. Lewis]]></summary></entry></feed>
