<p>It speaks volumes!</p>

<p>When we try to cage creativity into a closed environment (<em>like in a meeting-like setting</em>), it hardly ever flows.
And then, we go for a walk in a park by the side of a brook, our brain seems to tap into a limitless source 
of it.</p>

  <p>Most people who work for themselves have achieved work-life imbalance.</p>

  <p>~ Mokokoma Mokhonoana</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you start a new venture, you dream of the times when work is abundant and you reap what you have sowed.</p>

<p>To get there, though, requires an incredible push and work (<em>unless you are one of the lucky ones who‚Äôve found something so easy to attract customers, which hardly requires any work</em>). During this time, we often forget ourselves and put our health at peril. I should know about this; I do it all the time.</p>

<p>Last month I put my gym membership on hold to spend more time working on our product at <a href="https://beanmind.com">Bean Mind</a>. The product has enjoyed a significant push towards our MVP, but the cost has been quite steep. I feel less energised and need more breaks during the day. The good news is that I was reminded how important it is to get my work-life imbalance straight.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs important not to forget that without good health, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to accomplish so many dreams we would love to.</p>

<p>Not everything is lost; this past month has taught me to get on with it, go to the gym, and work smarter! üí™üèΩ</p>

<p>Since I was a little boy, I‚Äôve been surrounded by technology, it all started when I was ten years old, and I got my first computer. It was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_32/64">old machine</a> without any games, so I was forced to learn how to program. I soon became enamoured with technology and programming languages; I was fascinated by the worlds and possibilities I suddenly had at my fingertips.</p>

<p>Over time though, I lost my drive to program, <em>just for programming‚Äôs sake</em> and always looked for meaning: <em>‚ÄúWhy are we doing this?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the purpose of this application?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWho will it help?‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/bread_small.jpg" alt="image-right" class="align-right" />And then it changed yet again; even though I am surrounded by technology (<em>not just by the nature of my work, but all sorts of gadgets as well</em>), I love the simpler things in life. I love baking bread, cooking jam and marmalade, and preparing dishes with fresh ingredients daily.</p>

<p>My home is a mixture of new and old, juxtaposing times, and I would not have it any other way.</p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name><email>hello@ecomba.pro</email></author><category term="past" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all have rosy memories of a simpler, happy time- a time of homemade apple pie and gingham curtains, a time when Mom understood everything and Dad could fix anything. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get those traditional family values back!‚Äù we murmur to each other.

<p>It‚Äôs been like a few lifetimes since I blogged in here. To be fair, I nearly forgot that I had this little blog. How are you? Has life treated you well?</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had so many different adventures since I last posted here; they are to many to tell, but I might come back to tell you some at a later stage.</p>

<p>I am older now. Not sure I am wiser. Things are different and yet the same. I still want to help others with my work and still smile at the rising sun in the mornings.</p>

Bean Mind‚Äôs purpose is helping the coffee roasting businesses work more efficiently.

  <p>Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness.

<p>Recently someone sent me this poem from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis">C.S.Lewis</a>. When I first read it I felt uneasy about it. I could not understand the point of the poem. And then I saw the reason‚Ä¶</p>

<p>For Lewis love means opening our hearts to pain and sorrow. He sees the vulnerability of love as something negative, something to be avoided. Being vulnerable is the whole point of loving!</p>

<p>Loving, truly loving, is a deep connection in which you put yourself out in the open.</p>

<p><strong>The only alternative is to live without love; to be alone forever.</strong></p>

<p><em>Deep down though everyone of us knows that we were not born to be alone, everyone seeks connection.</em></p>

<p>This poem made me reflect on my work though. Over the years I have always tried to work for clients I can relate to, clients that at some level I had a connection to. People I could be vulnerable around and give them my true self. Only that way I am  capable of doing honest work, provide the best service money can buy.</p>

<p>If I‚Äôd hide my vulnerability away I would become a soulless creature in my emotional life and a worse professional for it.</p>
