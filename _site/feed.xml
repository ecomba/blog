  <p>By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I’m working on preparing some courses for 2024. While doing so, I’m also looking at what’s available in the market.</p>

<p>Most courses lack a thorough syllabus or the amount of time needed to absorb the knowledge to be prepared for the task the course is setting (or equipping) you to do. Some of them offer hands-on training, but many are just classroom-type classes.</p>

<p>The first course I’ll be releasing (<em>hopefully soon</em>) is directed to <em>agile coaches</em> who are either about to start or with just a little time under their belts and want to improve their skills.</p>

<p>It won’t give you a world-renowned certificate (<em>although I can create a certificate for you if you so desire</em>), but it will prepare you for the task at hand.</p>

<p>One thing I’m also toying with is the availability of myself after you’ve completed the course. Many times, when we learn a new skill, once we’ve learned it, we are left alone to deal with our newly acquired knowledge; I want to change that (<em>not sure how I will make that happen yet though</em>)!</p>

<p>If you are interested in knowing more, you have two options.</p>

  <p>Your values create your internal compass that can navigate how you make decisions in your life.</p>

  <p>~ Roy T. Bennett</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many companies these days claim to “<em>be agile</em>”; the reason is pretty simple: they have adopted some of the practices defined long ago in the “<em>agile manifesto</em>”.</p>

<p>The funny thing about this is that the practices are the <strong>easiest</strong> part of “<em>being agile</em>”.</p>

<p>Practices help to be agile; they are little crutches you use to acclimate to the new shift in perspective. The real benefit of agility is, interestingly enough, embedded in part in the very word: “<strong>agile</strong>”.</p>

<p>The values a company and its people adhere to dictate directly how adaptable to change they are or, controversially, how calcified they’ve become.</p>

<p>Are you process-heavy? Do you follow the agile theatre, but somehow, you aren’t very agile as a whole?</p>

<p>Do you remember when you first came into contact with agile software development?</p>

<p>For me, it was somewhat in the late 90’s. I remember that time fondly. We worked in a high-stakes environment, creating software for Germany’s first online insurance company. We were experiencing high pressure, and the stakes for our clients for such a disruptive product were even higher.</p>

<p>As one of the technical leads in our team, I was feeling the pressure; it was almost unbearable; something had to change.</p>

<p>That’s when I came across the <a href="http://c2.com">c2 wiki</a>. I spent so much time absorbing the knowledge embedded in those pages; it changed me.</p>

<p>Agile has always meant to be a change in your inner values, a joyful way of working, and ultimately focusing primarily on shipping software that matters.</p>

<p>Over the last decade(s), there has been a tendency to focus on rituals and team topology practices, which, if dissected, don’t add to the company’s bottom line in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>Are you overcomplicating your processes and teams? Is your software being shipped consistently?</p>

  <p>The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.</p>

  <p>~ Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a lovely catch-up with an old friend and fellow coach yesterday. We shared our life stories and what we’ve been up to up until now.</p>

<p><strong>Inevitably, we talked about our work as coaches.</strong></p>

<p>One thing that stood out for me is how there is a belief, in some communities and companies, that a coach is some tree-hugging, hippy person (<em>I have in no way or form anything against people focusing on these parts of the human experience</em>) focusing on intangibles that are way off the business’s primary focus.</p>

<p>Coaching a business, a team, or a person in a working environment has (<em>or, at the very minimum, should have</em>) measurable outcomes which will improve some key operating strategy for the company (<em>what, in detail, depends on the engagement</em>). Anything else is just a <em>” feel-good experience”</em> for the team (there is value in that too).</p>

<p><strong>What kind of coach do you need?</strong></p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong>: <em>If you are currently coaching teams and would like to be coached to become better at what you do, you can always <a href="https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/enrique-comba-riepenhausen">reach out to me</a>, and we’ll figure something out</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name><email>hello@ecomba.pro</email></author><category term="coaching" /><category term="work" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be. ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Anga!”</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023-12-13/anga" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="“Anga!”" /><published>2023-12-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-12-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023-12-13/anga</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023-12-13/anga"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>Speak when you are angry, and you will make the best speech you will ever regret.</p>

  <p>~ Ambrose Bierce</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You read that title right, “<em>Anga!</em>”. It reminded me of a short video clip from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harvey">Steve Harvey</a>, where he mocked someone for pronouncing the word “anger” as “anga”.</p>

<p>Recently, a business partner of mine wrote an email to a renowned person in some industry, asking them for advice.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, he received an answer that differed from what he expected. The reply was full of anger and frustration, to the point my business partner replied apologising for having caused any distress (<em>he still did not know where this was coming from</em>) and explaining more about what he was after.</p>

<p>This event prompted a conversation between us partners.</p>

<p>Here is my take on replying to unsolicited emails:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t reply in anger (<em>even if the mail made you angry for some unknown reason</em>).</li>
  <li>Instead, wait till it passes or don’t reply at all.</li>
  <li>Always be polite.</li>
  <li>If you are not interested in what the other person is offering, let them know (<em>politely</em>).</li>
  <li>It’s always better to reply than to keep silent (<em>you know how you feel when someone doesn’t answer your emails, calls, messages, etc.</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wonder how the story with the angry mailer ended, he apologised (<em>in his way</em>) and clarified where he was coming from… which could be a different blog post, so I’m leaving that for tomorrow…</p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name><email>hello@ecomba.pro</email></author><category term="musings" /><category term="emotions" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speak when you are angry, and you will make the best speech you will ever regret. ~ Ambrose Bierce]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“A better team”</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023-12-12/a-better-team" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="“A better team”" /><published>2023-12-12T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-12-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023-12-12/a-better-team</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023-12-12/a-better-team"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last ten years (<em>way more, but who’s counting 😅</em>), I’ve been thinking about a tool to help agile coaches and teams without a coach.</p>

<p>I had this problem a while ago when I started coaching and got my first few clients; <em>“How do I keep organised?”</em>, <em>“How do I share insights or activities with the teams?”</em></p>

<p>I always ended up using a mixture of different tools to keep myself organised. The problem with that (<em>at least for me</em>) is that I end up misplacing important information, missing key insights (<em>or spending too much time studying my notes</em>), making me work harder than I could.</p>

<p>A few years back, <a href="https://twitter.com/sbastn">Sebastian Hermida</a> created an excellent (and free) tool based on <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com">James Shores’</a> “Agile Self Assessment Quiz” (from the first edition of his book “<a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2">The Art of Agile Software Development</a>”).</p>

<p>Since then, though, it’s offline 😞.</p>

<p>Talking to Sebastian (<em>this is now about three years ago</em>), I asked him if I could use the name of the original domain he used as I wanted to create tools around agile coaching and helping teams get coaching. He gave me the green light to do whatever I liked with that domain.</p>

<p>So, now we are at the end of 2023, and my tool isn’t there yet, but I’ve got some renewed strength, and I’m seriously thinking of making this happen and scratching that old itch I have.</p>

  <p>Most people who work for themselves have achieved work-life imbalance.</p>

  <p>~ Mokokoma Mokhonoana</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you start a new venture, you dream of the times when work is abundant and you reap what you have sowed.</p>

<p>To get there, though, requires an incredible push and work (<em>unless you are one of the lucky ones who’ve found something so easy to attract customers, which hardly requires any work</em>). During this time, we often forget ourselves and put our health at peril. I should know about this; I do it all the time.</p>

<p>Last month I put my gym membership on hold to spend more time working on our product at <a href="https://beanmind.com">Bean Mind</a>. The product has enjoyed a significant push towards our MVP, but the cost has been quite steep. I feel less energised and need more breaks during the day. The good news is that I was reminded how important it is to get my work-life imbalance straight.</p>

<p>It’s important not to forget that without good health, we wouldn’t be able to accomplish so many dreams we would love to.</p>

<p>Not everything is lost; this past month has taught me to get on with it, go to the gym, and work smarter! 💪🏽</p>
