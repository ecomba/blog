  <p>Agility requires practice and preparation.</p>

  <p>~ Joshua Kerievsky, <a href="https://joyofagility.com">Joy of Agility</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>During my Christmas break, I am catching up with my reading, spending time reading the books I had set aside a while ago.</p>

<p>One of these books is <a href="https://joyofagility.com"><strong>Joy of Agility</strong></a> by <a href="https://www.industriallogic.com/people/joshua/">Joshua Kerievsky</a>. Having worked with Joshua a few years ago, I was thrilled to see him release this book after all the great work he‚Äôs been doing with <a href="https://modernagile.org">Modern Agile</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not going to talk about his book just yet (I‚Äôll leave that review to when I finish reading it), but I wanted to highlight this quote as it resonated with me and the way I feel about agility.</p>

<p>Many people think that being agile is <em>just</em> following a set of practices.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄùIf we follow these practices dictated by method <strong>S</strong> we will succeed in being <strong>A</strong>gile‚Äù (<em>or so the mantra goes</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth; agile is much more than a set of practices, but that‚Äôs for another day‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Being agile requires you to be good at what you do. You practice daily when your skills are needed to perform without overthinking about it.</p>

<p>Years ago, I was giving a class on <a href="https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/evolutionary-design/"><em>Evolutionary design</em></a> when one of the students told me that this way of working didn‚Äôt make much sense unless you know what you want at the end. I asked them what they meant by that. It turns out they didn‚Äôt trust their skills and intuition to take them on a journey to explore and code their design as it came along.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lack of (<em>coding</em>) practice was a barrier to entry for this technique.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This happens with other methods, too; they feel awkward to start, and you will always feel challenged when trying them out without training.</p>

<p>Do you need help with any agile techniques you want to use at your workplace?</p>

  <p>Christmas, children, is not a date. It is a state of mind.</p>

  <p>~ Mary Ellen Chase</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a strange time for me, especially this year. During Christmas time, people in the West celebrate some religious dates most of us don‚Äôt believe in. And yet, it‚Äôs somewhat magical; we come together, sit at a table and enjoy our company.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, the 24th of December was magical. We, the kids, would decorate the tree while my mother would spend almost all day in the kitchen preparing cookies and dinner for the evening.</p>

<p>Then, when the time was right, in the evening, we would be playing in my sisters‚Äô room (<em>it was the furthest from the living room</em>). My mother would take the presents from their hiding place and put them under the tree while we played. Then she would play the Christmas bells from the Austrian Choir on our stereo in the living room at full pelt, and, we kids would run, laughing to the living room finding the tree and living room lit up, the smell of pine in the air. It was a magical moment for us, in which Santa had become real and had left presents for us.</p>

<p><strong>I love the memories of that time.</strong></p>

<p>And yet, I haven‚Äôt been able to recreate this for future generations in my adult life. Life has taken me on so many adventures (far and wide) and never allowed me to create that magical moment, so I eventually stopped celebrating it.</p>

<p>This year, I feel even less inclined to celebrate (<em>is that even possible?</em>), yet some personal circumstances have given me a little stab to make tonight special for someones who deserve a magical moment in their lives.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm working on preparing some courses for 2024. While doing so, I‚Äôm also looking at what‚Äôs available in the market.</p>

<p>Most courses lack a thorough syllabus or the amount of time needed to absorb the knowledge to be prepared for the task the course is setting (or equipping) you to do. Some of them offer hands-on training, but many are just classroom-type classes.</p>

<p>The first course I‚Äôll be releasing (<em>hopefully soon</em>) is directed to <em>agile coaches</em> who are either about to start or with just a little time under their belts and want to improve their skills.</p>

<p>It won‚Äôt give you a world-renowned certificate (<em>although I can create a certificate for you if you so desire</em>), but it will prepare you for the task at hand.</p>

<p>One thing I‚Äôm also toying with is the availability of myself after you‚Äôve completed the course. Many times, when we learn a new skill, once we‚Äôve learned it, we are left alone to deal with our newly acquired knowledge; I want to change that (<em>not sure how I will make that happen yet though</em>)!</p>

  <p>Your values create your internal compass that can navigate how you make decisions in your life.</p>

  <p>~ Roy T. Bennett</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many companies these days claim to ‚Äú<em>be agile</em>‚Äù; the reason is pretty simple: they have adopted some of the practices defined long ago in the ‚Äú<em>agile manifesto</em>‚Äù.</p>

<p>The funny thing about this is that the practices are the <strong>easiest</strong> part of ‚Äú<em>being agile</em>‚Äù.</p>

<p>Practices help to be agile; they are little crutches you use to acclimate to the new shift in perspective. The real benefit of agility is, interestingly enough, embedded in part in the very word: ‚Äú<strong>agile</strong>‚Äù.</p>

<p>The values a company and its people adhere to dictate directly how adaptable to change they are or, controversially, how calcified they‚Äôve become.</p>

<p>Are you process-heavy? Do you follow the agile theatre, but somehow, you aren‚Äôt very agile as a whole?</p>

<p>Do you remember when you first came into contact with agile software development?</p>

<p>For me, it was somewhat in the late 90‚Äôs. I remember that time fondly. We worked in a high-stakes environment, creating software for Germany‚Äôs first online insurance company. We were experiencing high pressure, and the stakes for our clients for such a disruptive product were even higher.</p>

<p>As one of the technical leads in our team, I was feeling the pressure; it was almost unbearable; something had to change.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs when I came across the <a href="http://c2.com">c2 wiki</a>. I spent so much time absorbing the knowledge embedded in those pages; it changed me.</p>

<p>Agile has always meant to be a change in your inner values, a joyful way of working, and ultimately focusing primarily on shipping software that matters.</p>

<p>Over the last decade(s), there has been a tendency to focus on rituals and team topology practices, which, if dissected, don‚Äôt add to the company‚Äôs bottom line in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>Are you overcomplicating your processes and teams? Is your software being shipped consistently?</p>

  <p>The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.</p>

  <p>~ Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a lovely catch-up with an old friend and fellow coach yesterday. We shared our life stories and what we‚Äôve been up to up until now.</p>

<p><strong>Inevitably, we talked about our work as coaches.</strong></p>

<p>One thing that stood out for me is how there is a belief, in some communities and companies, that a coach is some tree-hugging, hippy person (<em>I have in no way or form anything against people focusing on these parts of the human experience</em>) focusing on intangibles that are way off the business‚Äôs primary focus.</p>

<p>Coaching a business, a team, or a person in a working environment has (<em>or, at the very minimum, should have</em>) measurable outcomes which will improve some key operating strategy for the company (<em>what, in detail, depends on the engagement</em>). Anything else is just a <em>‚Äù feel-good experience‚Äù</em> for the team (there is value in that too).</p>

<p><strong>What kind of coach do you need?</strong></p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong>: <em>If you are currently coaching teams and would like to be coached to become better at what you do, you can always <a href="https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/enrique-comba-riepenhausen">reach out to me</a>, and we‚Äôll figure something out</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name><email>hello@ecomba.pro</email></author><category term="coaching" /><category term="work" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be. ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Anga!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023-12-13/anga" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Anga!" /><published>2023-12-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-12-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023-12-13/anga</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023-12-13/anga"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>Speak when you are angry, and you will make the best speech you will ever regret.</p>

  <p>~ Ambrose Bierce</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You read that title right, ‚Äú<em>Anga!</em>‚Äù. It reminded me of a short video clip from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harvey">Steve Harvey</a>, where he mocked someone for pronouncing the word ‚Äúanger‚Äù as ‚Äúanga‚Äù.</p>

<p>Recently, a business partner of mine wrote an email to a renowned person in some industry, asking them for advice.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, he received an answer that differed from what he expected. The reply was full of anger and frustration, to the point my business partner replied apologising for having caused any distress (<em>he still did not know where this was coming from</em>) and explaining more about what he was after.</p>

<p>This event prompted a conversation between us partners.</p>

<p>Here is my take on replying to unsolicited emails:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don‚Äôt reply in anger (<em>even if the mail made you angry for some unknown reason</em>).</li>
  <li>Instead, wait till it passes or don‚Äôt reply at all.</li>
  <li>Always be polite.</li>
  <li>If you are not interested in what the other person is offering, let them know (<em>politely</em>).</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs always better to reply than to keep silent (<em>you know how you feel when someone doesn‚Äôt answer your emails, calls, messages, etc.</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you wonder how the story with the angry mailer ended, he apologised (<em>in his way</em>) and clarified where he was coming from‚Ä¶ which could be a different blog post, so I‚Äôm leaving that for tomorrow‚Ä¶</p>]]></content><author><name>Enrique Comba Riepenhausen</name><email>hello@ecomba.pro</email></author><category term="musings" /><category term="emotions" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Speak when you are angry, and you will make the best speech you will ever regret. ~ Ambrose Bierce]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A better team</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023-12-12/a-better-team" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A better team" /><published>2023-12-12T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-12-12T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023-12-12/a-better-team</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023-12-12/a-better-team"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last ten years (<em>way more, but who‚Äôs counting üòÖ</em>), I‚Äôve been thinking about a tool to help agile coaches and teams without a coach.</p>

<p>I had this problem a while ago when I started coaching and got my first few clients; <em>‚ÄúHow do I keep organised?‚Äù</em>, <em>‚ÄúHow do I share insights or activities with the teams?‚Äù</em></p>

<p>I always ended up using a mixture of different tools to keep myself organised. The problem with that (<em>at least for me</em>) is that I end up misplacing important information, missing key insights (<em>or spending too much time studying my notes</em>), making me work harder than I could.</p>

<p>A few years back, <a href="https://twitter.com/sbastn">Sebastian Hermida</a> created an excellent (and free) tool based on <a href="http://www.jamesshore.com">James Shores‚Äô</a> ‚ÄúAgile Self Assessment Quiz‚Äù (from the first edition of his book ‚Äú<a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2">The Art of Agile Software Development</a>‚Äù).</p>

<p>Since then, though, it‚Äôs offline üòû.</p>

<p>Talking to Sebastian (<em>this is now about three years ago</em>), I asked him if I could use the name of the original domain he used as I wanted to create tools around agile coaching and helping teams get coaching. He gave me the green light to do whatever I liked with that domain.</p>

<p>So, now we are at the end of 2023, and my tool isn‚Äôt there yet, but I‚Äôve got some renewed strength, and I‚Äôm seriously thinking of making this happen and scratching that old itch I have.</p>
