  <p>Wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow
– Anita Desai</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently I decided that It was time
for me to move on from <a href="http://makersacademy.com">Makers Academy</a> and
continue my journey.</p>

<p>Working at <a href="http://makersacademy.com">Makers Academy</a> has been a great
experience. I met really wonderful people and new friends. The feeling and
pride of helping people to learn how to code has been great; <strong>my heart will
always have this warm feeling about my time there</strong>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing I am still unsure what to do, there are some amazing
offers on the table, some crazy ideas and a ton of uncertainty. My decision 
at the moment is not to decide on anything. I am spending the month of
December in a sort-of-sabbatical where I will try not to think about anything
concrete (<em>this is proving difficult as my brain is finding idea after idea
at the moment</em>).</p>

<p>I am in that figurative crossroads looking into the different paths thinking
to myself: <em>“Which one of these has dragons and which one will lead me a 
little closer to mastery?”</em></p>

<p>If you have any idea of what I should do, let me know, I am all ears for any
proposal (<em>not deciding yet though</em>).</p>

<p>Oh, one last thing, regardless of the decision I have created a newsletter:
<strong><a href="https://tinyletter.com/ecomba">Enrique’s week in a bottle</a></strong> (<em>you can
also find a link on the sidebar</em>).</p>
