  <meta name="description" content="All this will not be finished in the first hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin. John F. Kennedy So my friend Roi and me have started this thing… a 100 days of creating content, or rather a 100 days of pushing code to github. Coding is a passion of mine, but recently I have been working mostly on private projects and repos, which is great, but we want to produce things that are useful for people as well. There are a ton of projects and ideas that one can build to help, and I am going to start working on some. I am thinking about a blogging engine that I thought about a while ago, but never got to work on as I somehow had the idea of it being a commercial product ( also I wanted to use it myself for blogging, maybe I will, maybe I will just create it and let others do it ). This might be a good starting project, I will see. The important part is working on something, many different things, to create the habit. Wish us luck and, hey if you have an idea that you don’t mind to be an open source project, just let us know!">
