&lt;p&gt;Laughing and having a good time is known to help in working and getting 
things done better; to be more productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I take at heart a lot. I have been called &lt;em&gt;child&lt;/em&gt; by some 
very serious developers (serious as in not smiling much) or looked at in 
sheer astonishment with the question &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;you guys are really working?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I work best, when my code is the cleanest, when I give the best business advice is when I am having fun. The lightheartedness of my spirit makes me grow and come up with a myriad of ideas and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you at your best?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;This post appeared first in March 2012 on my pervious blog at &lt;strong&gt;ecomba.org&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wherever you go becomes a part of you somehow
-- Anita Desai&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I decided that It was time
for me to move on from &lt;a href=&quot;http://makersacademy.com&quot;&gt;Makers Academy&lt;/a&gt; and
continue my journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working at &lt;a href=&quot;http://makersacademy.com&quot;&gt;Makers Academy&lt;/a&gt; has been a great
experience. I met really wonderful people and new friends. The feeling and
pride of helping people to learn how to code has been great; &lt;strong&gt;my heart will
always have this warm feeling about my time there&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing I am still unsure what to do, there are some amazing
offers on the table, some crazy ideas and a ton of uncertainty. My decision 
at the moment is not to decide on anything. I am spending the month of
December in a sort-of-sabbatical where I will try not to think about anything
concrete (&lt;em&gt;this is proving difficult as my brain is finding idea after idea
at the moment&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in that figurative crossroads looking into the different paths thinking
to myself: &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Which one of these has dragons and which one will lead me a 
little closer to mastery?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any idea of what I should do, let me know, I am all ears for any
proposal (&lt;em&gt;not deciding yet though&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, one last thing, regardless of the decision I have created a newsletter:
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyletter.com/ecomba&quot;&gt;Enrique&amp;#39;s week in a bottle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;you can
also find a link on the sidebar&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How it all starts</title>
   <link href="http://ecomba.pro/2014/08/31/in-the-beginning/"/>

   <id>http://ecomba.pro/2014/08/31/in-the-beginning</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I had the idea for &lt;a href=&quot;http://patheleven.com&quot;&gt;patheleven&lt;/a&gt; I wanted to bring
together a great team of people that wanted to grow and help other people
grow together. The main goal was to change the way we work and interact
with our customers and our surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During our time we learned a lot of valuable lessons and we learned what we
did and didn&amp;#39;t want from a company; &lt;strong&gt;it was a great adventure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know, we all disbanded and went our own ways to enjoy doing what we
like doing, but also to have a break from what we did with 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://patheleven.com&quot;&gt;patheleven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a small boutique software development shop is a really tough business,
 &lt;em&gt;we weren&amp;#39;t just building software for our customers, we were always trying
to exceed their expectations!&lt;/em&gt; This is really hard on every individual on the
team and so, we needed a rest...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why am I writing about all this then?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main motivation has always to help other people, see them grow and grow
myself in the process. At the same time though I am a person that loves a
certain lifestyle. I love nature and the mountains, I enjoy running and really
nice coffee ( &lt;em&gt;maybe I should start a coffee roaster&lt;/em&gt; ). I want to be able
to do all these things whenever I feel like doing them; I want to spend more
time in nature exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;http://makersacademy.com&quot;&gt;Makers Academy&lt;/a&gt; I have an amazing job and
responsibility with an amazing team of friends. It&amp;#39;s amazing what we do and
how we are able to change the life of the students that come to the course.
It&amp;#39;s not really a job, it suits my lifestyle. Yes, sometimes it is very hard,
and frustrating, but at the end it pays of to see this amazing people, our
students, having accomplished what they have in such a short time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still there has always been this idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://patheleven.com&quot;&gt;patheleven&lt;/a&gt;
nagging me in the back of my head. You might hear from it soon, or &lt;em&gt;maybe not
...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Introducing chronicler</title>
   <link href="http://ecomba.pro/2014/08/26/chronicler/"/>

   <id>http://ecomba.pro/2014/08/26/chronicler</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/08/25/100-days/&quot;&gt;yesterday I announced&lt;/a&gt; the idea &lt;a href=&quot;http://roidriscoll.github.io&quot;&gt;Roi&lt;/a&gt; and me had about committing every day to &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I set up a new project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ecomba/chronicler&quot;&gt;chronicler&lt;/a&gt; to start working on it for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ecomba/chronicler&quot;&gt;Chronicler&lt;/a&gt; is a blogging service that will focus on the content creation and ease of use. I want non-technical bloggers not to have to worry about anything but their content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code will be open source, but I will add a service as well for those who don&amp;#39;t want to deal with the technicalities of setting a chronicler instance up ( &lt;em&gt;big words... I haven&amp;#39;t even really started with the project and I am talking about these things already&lt;/em&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck with it and if you like the idea ( &lt;em&gt;once you see a little more of code in the project repo&lt;/em&gt; ) maybe you can chip in and help?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>100 days</title>

&lt;p&gt;All this will not be finished in the first hundred days. 
Nor will it be finished in the first thousand days, nor in 
the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in 
our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John F. Kennedy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my friend &lt;a href=&quot;http://roidriscoll.github.io&quot;&gt;Roi&lt;/a&gt; and me have started this thing... a &lt;a href=&quot;http://roidriscoll.github.io/blog/2014/08/25/100-days/&quot;&gt;100 days&lt;/a&gt; of creating content, or rather a 100 days of pushing code to &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coding is a passion of mine, but recently I have been working mostly on private projects and repos, which is great, but we want to produce things that are useful for people as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a ton of projects and ideas that one can build to help, and I am going to start working on some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking about a blogging engine that I thought about a while ago, but never got to work on as I somehow had the idea of it being a commercial product ( &lt;em&gt;also I wanted to use it myself for blogging, maybe I will, maybe I will just create it and let others do it&lt;/em&gt; ). This might be a good starting project, I will see. &lt;strong&gt;The important part is working on something, &lt;em&gt;many different things&lt;/em&gt;, to create the habit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish us luck and, &lt;strong&gt;hey&lt;/strong&gt; if you have an idea that you don&amp;#39;t mind to be an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source&quot;&gt;open source project&lt;/a&gt;, just let us know! &lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2014-08-24T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://ecomba.pro/2014/08/24/tmux</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Usually I keep &lt;em&gt;dot&lt;/em&gt; and configuration files somehow on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; so that I can retrieve them in case of a mayor disaster ( &lt;em&gt;laptop blowing up, etc&lt;/em&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I was pairing with a friend. I decided I wanted to share with him my remote pairing configuration... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WTF!!! WHERE DID IT GO?!?!?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to long ago my trusted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/&quot;&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; stopped working and I changed it for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://makersacademy.com&quot;&gt;Makers Academy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/&quot;&gt;MackBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;em&gt;a really nice machine if you ask me&lt;/em&gt; ). Given that I am not working remotely at the moment I didn&amp;#39;t have any &lt;a href=&quot;http://tmux.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/a&gt; or my trusted configurations setup... &lt;em&gt;a real bummer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I quickly installed it and went through it with him, but having learned the lesson, I added it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/ecomba&quot;&gt;my github&lt;/a&gt; for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are remotely interested in my &lt;a href=&quot;http://tmux.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/a&gt; configuration you can take a look at it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/ecomba/tmux-conf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hell is something you carry around with you. Not somewhere you go.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—Neil Gaiman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had a wonderful &lt;em&gt;Talks Night (tm)&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://makersacademy.com&quot;&gt;Makers Academy&lt;/a&gt;! If you haven&amp;#39;t ever been to a &lt;strong&gt;Makers Academy Talks Night&lt;/strong&gt;  and you happen to be a student at our academy, you definitely should!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;strong&gt;Makers Academy Talks Night&lt;/strong&gt; you will learn a lot of things that you possibly didn&amp;#39;t know about, like how to produce music, how to save money by batch-cooking, Venezuela, Singapore, women in tech, ... &lt;strong&gt;you name it&lt;/strong&gt; It is a really great evening and the kudos really go to all the students, but specially to those who had the courage to stand in front of everyone giving a talk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a little about this concept, I have been talking about a little for the last five years or so, as I gave a talk about it during our &lt;strong&gt;Makers Academy Talks Night&lt;/strong&gt; yesterday; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/talks/mushin-no-shin&quot;&gt;Mushin no shin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your brain does many things to cope, specially when under perceived stress conditions (&lt;em&gt;learning in a bootcamp counts as such&lt;/em&gt;), it might default to &lt;strong&gt;fear&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;or rather anxiety&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;anger&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;ego&lt;/strong&gt;. These are all natural emotions that we all experience in our lifetimes (&lt;em&gt;sometimes even multiple times a day&lt;/em&gt;). The problem with all of them is that they will not help you in those situations that require your full attention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mind is troubled and there is a lot of chatter that does not allow you to react to the situation at hand as you are to busy inside your emotional state. &lt;em&gt;Mushin no shin&lt;/em&gt;, or the mind that is no mind is a state in which your mind is not fixed or busy with thought or emotion, but rather open to everything. It is an ideal mind state in which you can absorb knowledge at incredible speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is a difficult state of mind to achieve and to keep, but as everything we do, it&amp;#39;s not about how easy it is, but how much we invest in it for our own sake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dwelling in the future</title>

&lt;p&gt;Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact.
Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Marcus Aurelius&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another year has passed, and it has been a quite interesting year. A lot of things have happened in this past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write this post as a retrospection on what has been happening in this past year, but I feel like this would be &lt;em&gt;dwelling in the past&lt;/em&gt;, something I advocate not to do to anyone that asks me. So following my own advice I am going to just say what I do want to do in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;I want to spend more time exercising&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of last year I began to run again. This is a mayor achievement for me (&lt;em&gt;I need a badge for that!&lt;/em&gt;) as I haven&amp;#39;t exercised in ages before that. I have found that running gives me some peace of mind, similar as meditation does for a lot of people. I definitely want to keep on doing this and set time aside for it (&lt;em&gt;hopefully every day&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;I want to write more&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing is hard. You need a lot of alone time to be able to do this (&lt;em&gt;writers confinement&lt;/em&gt;). At times I have a lot of drive to write and it seems that I cannot stop doing it, but other times  no single word comes out of my hands. I want to do this more. This Christmas I set a little task for myself (&lt;em&gt;which I have been doing&lt;/em&gt;) of writing every morning some thoughts, an account of the past day, or just about anything that was on my mind. I hope that this new year I will be able to produce more writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;I want to write more software&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually write a ton of software. I code every day on different languages and things to satisfy my ever growing curiosity. What I feel though is that I want to release more products to the world. Not as a capital gain or to make any successful business out of them (although that would be welcome as well), but to actually produce something that people can use in their daily lives that will help them somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;I want to reach out more to my friends&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love my friends! They are all over the globe and meeting them is always linked with a trip to somewhere else. The problem with me is that I am not really good at communicating with the people I hold dear when they are not around. It&amp;#39;s so easy to fall into the daily &lt;em&gt;grind&lt;/em&gt; and forget to tell someone you appreciate that you are thinking about them. This year I am going to try to do that more and keep in contact with my friends (&lt;em&gt;If you are one of them and you are reading this, I am really sorry that I suck so much in keeping the contact alive&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;I want to loose and gain some habits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I spent a lot of time reading about habits and living a simpler lifestyle. This is something that resonates with me. I have been working on that over the past few years, and I want to continue doing that. Life is simple, we should keep our lifestyle simple as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that I think that I will keep on helping as many people as I can (easy with &lt;a href=&quot;http://makersacademy.com&quot;&gt;my current line of work&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy 2014 to everyone out there!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was about to open my email client and start sending Christmas emails to everyone I know. Then I thought that maybe I should first write this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time of the year the lucky ones amongst us gather with family and loved ones to celebrate; some for religious reasons, others as an excuse to spend some days together once a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some amongst us, less lucky, with no place to go. For those of you, who have nowhere to go or no family, loved ones or friends to spend the night with I extend my love; &lt;strong&gt;you are in my thoughts tonight&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my friends close and far, my colleagues at work and people I have worked with during this past year &lt;strong&gt;I love you all!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Merry Christmas to you all!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;And now I am off to celebrate with my family...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our doubts are traitors,
and make us lose the good we oft might win,
by fearing to attempt.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ William Shakespeare&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you push yourself out of your comfort zone you often confront yourself with your &lt;em&gt;resistance&lt;/em&gt;. It shouts at you and makes you doubt about your ability, your intelligence, your &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest fight for the learner it the fight with his inner self, the countless battles fought with &lt;em&gt;resistance&lt;/em&gt; in order to step outside your &lt;em&gt;comfort zone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;em&gt;resistance&lt;/em&gt; is the devil on your shoulder telling you that you can never truly learn that hard new skill you want to acquire. It tells you that the hard work you are putting into learning does not matter. That the knowledge that is clamoring to leap out of you will always be restrained by social pressure, time, and the ringing words of all those who have laughed at your in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fight it, you are not alone, we all suffer this malady and we all fight everyday with it to get ourselves up on our feet yet again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I teach at Makers Academy</title>

   <id>http://ecomba.pro/2013/11/10/why-makers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been asked a couple of times now why I teach at &lt;a href=&quot;http://makersacademy.com&quot;&gt;Makers Academy&lt;/a&gt; instead of making &lt;em&gt;a lot of money&lt;/em&gt; with my skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could write about many reasons that this is so; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/shadchnev&quot;&gt;being&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/startuprob&quot;&gt;part&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/JordanPoulton&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/alexpeattie&quot;&gt;an&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/anitacanita&quot;&gt;awesome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rubenkostucki&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/Jamedjo&quot;&gt;helps&lt;/a&gt;, but that is not the main reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last friday, at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://alumni.makersacademy.com/cohorts/august&quot;&gt;graduation&lt;/a&gt;, magic happened while having an inocent conversation with the mother of one of our graduates; a humbling moment; a compliment; an inspiring gesture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different reasons that make teaching a fullfilling calling, but that conversation trumped everything so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 12 weeks you have achieved what I, as a mother, haven&amp;#39;t in a lifetime; thank you!
~ mom&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Use your imagination</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination. ~ Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest thing for a learner is to start being able to use his imagination in order to apply his knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we learn something new, we learn a way of doing something, a syntax. This information will not stick long in our heads if we don&amp;#39;t practice, practice, practice the newly acquired skill a lot while it is still fresh in our heads. Once we do though something interesting starts to happen. Our brain starts recognising patterns and weaving new ideas and ways we could accomplish the same thing or improve over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A musician learns to play note by note a song. It sounds boring and lifeless, even if he hits every note perfectly well. But as he practices over and over he starts making that song his; a piece of his soul wanders into his instrument and the notes he is playing, art happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you learn something novell, go over what you have learned, a million times and over again, but then, let your imagination and your playfulness have a go at it and create new pathways and patterns around the acquired knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Writing for the next developer</title>
   <link href="http://ecomba.pro/2013/10/19/the-next-developer/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-19T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
   <id>http://ecomba.pro/2013/10/19/the-next-developer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day I was going through some code with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/shadchnev&quot;&gt;Evgeny&lt;/a&gt; and we had a discussion about the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/954570/definition-of-clean-code&quot;&gt;cleanness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of it. The code in question was by no means wrong or anything, but it &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you spend years in a profession you have an intuition about what can be done better and what feels wrong (&lt;em&gt;we usually call this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell&quot;&gt;code smells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, let&amp;#39;s go back to the code in question, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a piece of code that allows a person to rent a bike from a docking station (&lt;em&gt;in London we call these things &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays_Cycle_Hire&quot;&gt;Boris Bikes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). The docking station would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;class DockingStation
  def rent(bike)
    # something interesting happens here to return a bike
  end
end  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking closer at that piece of code we notice that the caller will have to know about the existance of a given bike inside that station for him to actually be able to rent the bike. Now that we have decided for this interface we have to provide a means for the caller to at least see the bikes in the docking station:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;class DockingStation
  def available_bikes
    # return collection of the bikes
    # in the station
  end
end  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at this from the point of view of a real life scenario, a person wanting to rent a bike will most definitely &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; his bike from the ones he can see on the station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you look at this problem from the point of view that a bike is stored in a database and will have to be pulled from the database in order for it to be rented it might look as it is perfectly OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far so good... &lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s my problem with this code then?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue I have with this approach is the amount of &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; the caller has to have about the inner representation of the docking station in order to rent &lt;em&gt;a bike&lt;/em&gt; from a docking station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most codebases are not build around the notion of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design&quot;&gt;user experience&lt;/a&gt; the next developer will have with the code we produce. How easy will it be to use? How much will we have to read in order to understand how to use this code? Will it make us happy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time thinking in those terms when I am coding, I am not only solving a problem, I am making conscious choices about how my code will be used and what you can expect from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s look a a different approach to this problem; &lt;em&gt;renting a bike from a docking station&lt;/em&gt;. What the caller to the docking station ultimately wants to do is &lt;em&gt;renting a bike&lt;/em&gt;. He doesn&amp;#39;t want to deal with any specifics of the docking station, it&amp;#39;s not his responsiblilty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;class DockingStation
  def rent_bike
    # do something to return an available bike
  end
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we have decided to include what was the argument to the method into the methods signature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have we achived here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all we don&amp;#39;t need to pass in an argument to the method anymore, which makes the code simpler to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, by including what was the arguments name in the previous example in the method signature, we have now a method that &lt;a href=&quot;http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?IntentionRevealingNames&quot;&gt;reveals its intent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally the caller no longer has to know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; things are done inside the docking station; the inner structure is left to be the dockings stations responsability. This actually has many advantages as we can change that inner structure any time without affecting any code that uses our docking station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the most important lesson here is that we have made the life of the next developer easier; we have thought about what he will experience and feel while using our docking station. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#39;s your turn!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Next time you are writing code think about what the next developer will feel and experience when interacting with your code.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>You cannot teach someone to code in n-weeks</title>
   <link href="http://ecomba.pro/2013/10/18/cannot-teach/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You read that right. Surprised? Challenged? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear those words a lot from people not involved in helping people to learn how to code. It seems, to them, that what we are doing is something that cannot be accomplished; the human brain appears (&lt;em&gt;to them again&lt;/em&gt;) not to be capable of processing the sheer amount of information needed to become a developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having done this now for some while I could not disagree more with the title of this blogpost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen people developing skills that they did not have before on a weekly basis. Makers that only used their computers to entertain themselves suddenly are capable, within a few weeks (&lt;em&gt;three to be exact&lt;/em&gt;) to develop a domain model with objects interacting with each other, &lt;strong&gt;TEST FIRST!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, in the second week of learning how to code, I see people solving &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)&quot;&gt;coding katas&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataFizzBuzz&quot;&gt;FizzBuzz&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRomanNumerals&quot;&gt;Roman Numerals&lt;/a&gt; katas&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human brain is capable of absorbing and processing huge amounts of information, we do that every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our challenge&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;finding and perfecting ways to tap into that potential in order to unleash the full learning capacity of the human brain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could learn a lot from crayons: some are sharp, 
some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, 
some have weird names, but they have all learned to 
live in the same box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I got my new blogging engine &lt;a href=&quot;http://ghost.org&quot;&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; up and 
running. I pretended to have a more &lt;em&gt;dramatic&lt;/em&gt; blog entry as my first one, 
but to be honest I am so excited about having this thing working and running 
after I have put in so much effort into it the last couple of days that I 
just needed to get something out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, in the (&lt;em&gt;hopefully&lt;/em&gt; near) future I will post my ideas and thoughts 
about many software related (and unrelated) things...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E!&lt;/p&gt;
