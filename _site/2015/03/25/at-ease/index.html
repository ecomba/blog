<p>Being at ease is easier said than done. It’s the feeling of feeling comfortable in your own skin; no matter where you are (<em>work, with friends, etc</em>).</p>

<p>It’s something so simple and yet so difficult to achieve, there are people we feel we need to please, the social pressure…</p>

<p>The question is, <strong>why do you think you have to please anyone?</strong> The only person that really matters in your life is <strong>you</strong>. You have to live with yourself for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>Being at ease, finding comfort in who you are, is possibly the first (<em>and possibly only</em>) step you should take in your daily interaction with people.</p>
