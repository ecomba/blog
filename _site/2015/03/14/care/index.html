  <meta name="description" content="When people talk about what they do in the software development field they talk about best practices, clean code, engineering, etc. All these things are absolutely great if you think about them, but there is something else, something that we introduced when we started the Software Craftsmanship movement, care. When you care about what you do, you not only use the best of your ability as you work, you transmit a little of yourself into your work. The products, services and software you build become part of what you are, they get imprinted with your DNA. There are not many people who do work like this, it’s still very rare.
