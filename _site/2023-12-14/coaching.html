  <blockquote>
  <p>The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.</p>

  <p>~ Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had a lovely catch-up with an old friend and fellow coach yesterday. We shared our life stories and what we’ve been up to up until now.</p>

<p><strong>Inevitably, we talked about our work as coaches.</strong></p>

<p>One thing that stood out for me is how there is a belief, in some communities and companies, that a coach is some tree-hugging, hippy person (<em>I have in no way or form anything against people focusing on these parts of the human experience</em>) focusing on intangibles that are way off the business’s primary focus.</p>

<p>Coaching a business, a team, or a person in a working environment has (<em>or, at the very minimum, should have</em>) measurable outcomes which will improve some key operating strategy for the company (<em>what, in detail, depends on the engagement</em>). Anything else is just a <em>” feel-good experience”</em> for the team (there is value in that too).</p>

<p><strong>What kind of coach do you need?</strong></p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong>: <em>If you are currently coaching teams and would like to be coached to become better at what you do, you can always <a href="https://calendly.com/ecomba/free-consultation">reach out to me</a>, and we’ll figure something out</em>.</p>
