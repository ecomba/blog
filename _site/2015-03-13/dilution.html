<p>We see it over and over – A nice burger joint opens, they serve delicious food.
Someone down the line decides it’s time to reduce costs by diluting the 
ingredients, using cheaper products, etc. You still go there; for a while.
Eventually though you decide it’s time to move on and try that other place out…</p>

<p><em>Sadly this is commonplace in businesses frozen in past practices.</em></p>

<p>You want to have a service, product, company that your customers will love?
The trick is pretty simple…</p>

<p><strong>Never ever insult them by reducing the quality of what you once were!</strong></p>
