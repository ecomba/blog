Why are video games more popular than work? … Why do many workers spend years dreaming about and planning for retirement? The reason is simple and dispiriting.

  <p>“Why do so many people work so hard so they can escape to Disneyland? Why are video games more popular than work? … Why do many workers spend years dreaming about and planning for retirement?</p>

  <p>The reason is simple and dispiriting. We have made the workplace a frustrating and joyless place where people do what they’re told and have few ways to participate in decisions or fully use their talents. As a result, they naturally gravitate to pursuits in which they can exercise a measure of control over their lives.</p>

  <p>In most organisations I have been exposed to around the world, … we still have the offices “above” the working people … who, without consulting workers, make decisions that dramatically affect their lives.</p>

<p>Stop playing video games to escape your reality! Stop trying to control the little things that don’t really count to much in your life.</p>

<p>You are exceptional and incredibly capable of doing what you should be doing.</p>

<p>Things need to change,</p>

<p><strong>we need to regain control of our <em>self</em>!</strong></p>
