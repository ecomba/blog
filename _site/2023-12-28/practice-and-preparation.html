  <blockquote>
  <p>Agility requires practice and preparation.</p>

  <p>~ Joshua Kerievsky, <a href="https://joyofagility.com">Joy of Agility</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>During my Christmas break, I am catching up with my reading, spending time reading the books I had set aside a while ago.</p>

<p>One of these books is <a href="https://joyofagility.com"><strong>Joy of Agility</strong></a> by <a href="https://www.industriallogic.com/people/joshua/">Joshua Kerievsky</a>. Having worked with Joshua a few years ago, I was thrilled to see him release this book after all the great work he’s been doing with <a href="https://modernagile.org">Modern Agile</a>.</p>

<p>I’m not going to talk about his book just yet (I’ll leave that review to when I finish reading it), but I wanted to highlight this quote as it resonated with me and the way I feel about agility.</p>

<p>Many people think that being agile is <em>just</em> following a set of practices.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>”If we follow these practices dictated by method <strong>S</strong> we will succeed in being <strong>A</strong>gile” (<em>or so the mantra goes</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing could be further from the truth; agile is much more than a set of practices, but that’s for another day…</p>

<p>Being agile requires you to be good at what you do. You practice daily when your skills are needed to perform without overthinking about it.</p>

<p>Years ago, I was giving a class on <a href="https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/evolutionary-design/"><em>Evolutionary design</em></a> when one of the students told me that this way of working didn’t make much sense unless you know what you want at the end. I asked them what they meant by that. It turns out they didn’t trust their skills and intuition to take them on a journey to explore and code their design as it came along.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lack of (<em>coding</em>) practice was a barrier to entry for this technique.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This happens with other methods, too; they feel awkward to start, and you will always feel challenged when trying them out without training.</p>

<p>Do you need help with any agile techniques you want to use at your workplace?</p>
