  <p>Most people who work for themselves have achieved work-life imbalance.</p>

  <p>~ Mokokoma Mokhonoana</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you start a new venture, you dream of the times when work is abundant and you reap what you have sowed.</p>

<p>To get there, though, requires an incredible push and work (<em>unless you are one of the lucky ones who‚Äôve found something so easy to attract customers, which hardly requires any work</em>). During this time, we often forget ourselves and put our health at peril. I should know about this; I do it all the time.</p>

<p>Last month I put my gym membership on hold to spend more time working on our product at <a href="https://beanmind.com">Bean Mind</a>. The product has enjoyed a significant push towards our MVP, but the cost has been quite steep. I feel less energised and need more breaks during the day. The good news is that I was reminded how important it is to get my work-life imbalance straight.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs important not to forget that without good health, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to accomplish so many dreams we would love to.</p>

<p>Not everything is lost; this past month has taught me to get on with it, go to the gym, and work smarter! üí™üèΩ</p>

<p>Small steps‚Ä¶</p>
