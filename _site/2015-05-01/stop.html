  <p>We focus so much on our differences, and that is creating, 
I think, a lot of chaos and negativity and bullying in the 
world. And I think if everybody focused on what we all have 
in common - which is - we all want to be happy.</p>

  <p>~ Ellen DeGeneres</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The increasing amount of negativity in the world is mind boggling to me. Yes there are issues, yes, we all have to fix them <strong>together</strong>.</p>

<p>But there are two approaches to this, you can either insult, patronise, be rude, etc., or you can choose to be polite, understanding, empathic.</p>

<p>Yes, I am a privileged white man (<em>words someone used to attack me on the internet</em>), but I choose to use my privilege to help others. If you insult me, try to burn me, I will turn my back to you, continue doing what I am doing helping the world becoming a better place, while you keep on shouting and using your angry ways.</p>

<p>The only thing I ask you, as an intelligent human being, to <strong>stop being a jerk on the internet!</strong> Being far away, protected by the intimacy of your home, does not give you the right to insult others back and forth.</p>

<p>There is a good remedy for this, if you are interested:</p>

<p><em>Get out of your house (and your head), step outside, look at the world in wonder, and start helping others (and living your life).</em></p>

<p>And if you happen to be less privileged, seek help from people that will honestly look after you and offer real help, not just some way for them to feel better about themselves.</p>
