**Do you trust the people you work with?**

Don’t just go and and answer _”yes”_. Think about it first. And besides, no one is going to hear your answer anyways.

What does it mean to **really** trust someone?

They are the people you know that will do anything in their hands to help you with whatever problem you have; they are rare.

In the work environment you will possibly not achieve this level of trust I am talking about, but you will definitely know if you don’t trust someone.

If you don’t trust the people you work with find someone you do trust – you will enjoy work and your life far more.

**Trust me on that!**
