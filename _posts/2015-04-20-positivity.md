I bet you know someone who is always positive, never in a bad mood, eternal Pan Am smile on their face.

**_Some people are just way to positive, arenâ€™t they?_**

Being positive, or having a good mood, is a decision you take every morning by and for yourself. When you wake up you decide to have a good or a bad day.

The environment that surrounds you has a huge impact on how you are going to feel. Surround yourself with bad news and you will inevitably be sucked into it.

So, for today, and the rest of the week if you dare, surround yourself by people that are nice to you, get inspired and smile a little more (_the sun is shining after all_)!
