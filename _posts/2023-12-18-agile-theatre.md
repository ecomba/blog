Many companies these days claim to “_be agile_”; the reason is pretty simple: they have adopted some of the practices defined long ago in the “_agile manifesto_”.

The funny thing about this is that the practices are the **easiest** part of “_being agile_”.

Practices help to be agile; they are little crutches you use to acclimate to the new shift in perspective. The real benefit of agility is, interestingly enough, embedded in part in the very word: “**agile**”.

The values a company and its people adhere to dictate directly how adaptable to change they are or, controversially, how calcified they’ve become.

Are you process-heavy? Do you follow the agile theatre, but somehow, you aren’t very agile as a whole?
