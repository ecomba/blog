People like the late Steve Jobs where known for their incredible ability to develop a laser sharp focus when it came to work.

Mastery in a skill takes a lifetime of dedication and perfection. You need to practice day in and day out honing the skill.

The problem comes when the skill you practice is the only thing you practice. As a developer you need to hone a whole array of skills ranging from a notion of design, business, marketing, human empathy, etc.

Coding, alas the one you will focus the most in, should not be your only skill.

**Your focus should lie on being an all-round better person.**
