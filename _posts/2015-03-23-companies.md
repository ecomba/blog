The way we perceive companies from the outside varies. Most look like a thing, a faceless corporation that offers a product or a service – _a tribe_.

How the company is perceived within; that’s a more interesting question.

Sadly I see a lot of places in where people are completely disengaged by their work or company. They are there because it pays the bills.

In other companies there is the will to do meaningful work, but somehow “_the company_” is making it hard.

Either way, that concept of a company, in the smaller scale, is obsolete.

**You should strive to work in a place that gives your work meaning, a place where you can express yourself!**
