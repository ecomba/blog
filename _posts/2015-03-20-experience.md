**I love the world we are living in!** 

When I was younger people were judged (_and got their great reputation_) by their titles and what they had studied. If you had a doctor title, were a professor or anything alike **you were someone**.

The world has changed though. A title proves you knew how to pass a test; you mastered the ability to keep your head down and to all the things needed to earn it.

People are judged by the value they bring to others, by what they do and how they are able to make the lives of others better than they were before they met.

You are what you can do, not who you say you are.

_What can **you** do? How will you **improve my life** if we meet?_
