My son can play video games for 8 hours straight, for possibly a month or longer.

Now as a responsible parent you would not allow that to happen, but that is not really the interesting bit here.

The question you have to ask to yourself is _”why is it we can spend 8 hours straight doing something?”_ – the answer you will soon realise is actually quite simple, **we have fun doing it.**

And yet, when it comes to work we end up doing things that we either don’t like or don’t particularly enjoy.

We should aim to create workplaces we really enjoy working in, where everyone has fun and that add to our lives, filling us with energy.

**That would be a place even my game playing son would love to work in!**
