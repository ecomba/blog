title: Introducing chronicler
---

So [yesterday I announced](/2014/08/25/100-days/) the idea [Roi](http://roidriscoll.github.io) and me had about committing every day to [github](http://github.com).

Today I set up a new project, [chronicler](https://github.com/ecomba/chronicler) to start working on it for some time.

[Chronicler](https://github.com/ecomba/chronicler) is a blogging service that will focus on the content creation and ease of use. I want non-technical bloggers not to have to worry about anything but their content.

The code will be open source, but I will add a service as well for those who don't want to deal with the technicalities of setting a chronicler instance up ( _big words... I haven't even really started with the project and I am talking about these things already_ ).

Wish me luck with it and if you like the idea ( _once you see a little more of code in the project repo_ ) maybe you can chip in and help?
