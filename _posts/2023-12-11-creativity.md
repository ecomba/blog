While having coffee again this morning, I came across this image (from _@WisdomMadeEasy_).

It speaks volumes!

When we try to cage creativity into a closed environment (_like in a meeting-like setting_), it hardly ever flows.
And then, we go for a walk in a park by the side of a brook, our brain seems to tap into a limitless source 
of it.

Maybe next time you want to schedule a meeting to “_be creative together_” instead of that meeting, let your people go 
for an extended walk and see what they've come up with afterwards!
