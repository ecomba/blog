You read that right. Surprised? Challenged? 

I hear those words a lot from people not involved in helping people to learn how to code. It seems, to them, that what we are doing is something that cannot be accomplished; the human brain appears (*to them again*) not to be capable of processing the sheer amount of information needed to become a developer.

Having done this now for some while I could not disagree more with the title of this blogpost.

I have seen people developing skills that they did not have before on a weekly basis. Makers that only used their computers to entertain themselves suddenly are capable, within a few weeks (*three to be exact*) to develop a domain model with objects interacting with each other, **TEST FIRST!**

In fact, in the second week of learning how to code, I see people solving [coding katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) (*like the [FizzBuzz](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataFizzBuzz) or the [Roman Numerals](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRomanNumerals) katas*).

The human brain is capable of absorbing and processing huge amounts of information, we do that every day.

**Our challenge**: *finding and perfecting ways to tap into that potential in order to unleash the full learning capacity of the human brain*.
