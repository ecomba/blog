Curiosity drives the minds of the human nature. We seek and seek to understand. Sometimes we ask questions when we don’t understand something, sometimes we show the world what we have found or what we have – within the limits of our own perception – witnessed.

With the rise of the _Social Media_ this has been multiplied to a great extent. What someone said in one remote corner of the world is oftentimes discussed in a complete different corner of the world.

It incredible beautiful and empowering how we can make our world shrink and bring us all together.
  
Sadly though, this is not the only thing happening. Every comment is directed, every opinion turned over. The curious get shot down with angry comments, the opinions of others assaulted.

The web we have created is turning into an hostile place to be in. There is a lot of anger in the world. I am no one to tell you to change, but next time you want to give an off response to someone try to sit back, think again about the context and relax a moment.

_There is no need to be insulting strangers all over the world just because they are not standing in front of you._
