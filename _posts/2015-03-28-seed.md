Your mind can be influenced very easily – words we say to others can prime them to fail or do great.

_It’s quite remarkable how we are wired._

Next time you feel a certain way (_anxious, amazing, etc_) spend some time thinking why that is. Did you or someone else say something that made you feel that way?
