> ~ William Shakespeare

When you push yourself out of your comfort zone you often confront yourself with your *resistance*. It shouts at you and makes you doubt about your ability, your intelligence, your *self*.

The biggest fight for the learner it the fight with his inner self, the countless battles fought with *resistance* in order to step outside your *comfort zone*.

Your *resistance* is the devil on your shoulder telling you that you can never truly learn that hard new skill you want to acquire. It tells you that the hard work you are putting into learning does not matter. That the knowledge that is clamoring to leap out of you will always be restrained by social pressure, time, and the ringing words of all those who have laughed at your in the past.

**Fight it, you are not alone, we all suffer this malady and we all fight everyday with it to get ourselves up on our feet yet again.**
