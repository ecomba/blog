When was the last time you laughed at work? The last time you felt you are having a really good time as you work through your tasks?

It’s surprising how many people struggle to find joy whilst working. Yes, sometimes we do things we do not like, work at jobs that we’d rather not do.

I still challenge you, even if you don’t like what you are currently doing, to find a little joy in it.
