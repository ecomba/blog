I was about to open my email client and start sending Christmas emails to everyone I know. Then I thought that maybe I should first write this blog post.

This time of the year the lucky ones amongst us gather with family and loved ones to celebrate; some for religious reasons, others as an excuse to spend some days together once a year.

There are some amongst us, less lucky, with no place to go. For those of you, who have nowhere to go or no family, loved ones or friends to spend the night with I extend my love; **you are in my thoughts tonight**.

For my friends close and far, my colleagues at work and people I have worked with during this past year **I love you all!**

**A Merry Christmas to you all!**

<small>*And now I am off to celebrate with my family...*</small>
