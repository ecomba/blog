Finally I got my new blogging engine [ghost](http://ghost.org) up and 
running. I pretended to have a more *dramatic* blog entry as my first one, 
but to be honest I am so excited about having this thing working and running 
after I have put in so much effort into it the last couple of days that I 
just needed to get something out.


Anyhow, in the (*hopefully* near) future I will post my ideas and thoughts 
about many software related (and unrelated) things...


Wish me luck!

E!
