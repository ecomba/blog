Being at ease is easier said than done. It’s the feeling of feeling comfortable in your own skin; no matter were you are (_work, with friends, etc_).

It’s something so simple and yet so difficult to achieve, there are people we feel we need to please, the social pressure…

The question is, **why do you think you have to please anyone?** The only person that really matters in your life is **you**. You have to live with yourself for the rest of your life.

Being at ease, finding comfort in who you are, is possibly the first (_and possibly only_) step you should take in your daily interaction with people.
