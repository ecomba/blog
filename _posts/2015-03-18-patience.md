Sometimes things don’t happen the way, or rather at the pace we want them to happen. Things move slower than (_we_) expected.

How are you going to react in that situation? Are you going to be the one who shouts, gets restless and insulting? Or are you going to be the one who relaxes and takes a look at the situation and tries to make the best out of it given the circumstances?

The way you feel, your attitude to challenging situations, is your choice; 

**who are you going to be today?**
