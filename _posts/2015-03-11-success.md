**How do you define success?**

Many people think of success in terms of monetary rewards (_accumulation
of wealth_), others in how wellknown they or their venture is (_there are
many other definitions, which I am not going to go into_).

None of these definitions ever struck a chord with me.

I'd like to define successful people as those who get a great satisfaction of
what they do everyday.

Are you there? Do you get that tingling sensation every day before you start?

What can you do to get there? Can I help you?
