So my friend [Roi](http://roidriscoll.github.io) and me have started this thing... a [100 days](http://roidriscoll.github.io/blog/2014/08/25/100-days/) of creating content, or rather a 100 days of pushing code to [github](http://github.com).

Coding is a passion of mine, but recently I have been working mostly on private projects and repos, which is great, but we want to produce things that are useful for people as well.

There are a ton of projects and ideas that one can build to help, and I am going to start working on some.

I am thinking about a blogging engine that I thought about a while ago, but never got to work on as I somehow had the idea of it being a commercial product ( _also I wanted to use it myself for blogging, maybe I will, maybe I will just create it and let others do it_ ). This might be a good starting project, I will see. **The important part is working on something, _many different things_, to create the habit**.

Wish us luck and, **hey** if you have an idea that you don't mind to be an [open source project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), just let us know!
