Recently I decided that It was time
for me to move on from [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com) and
continue my journey.

Working at [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com) has been a great
experience. I met really wonderful people and new friends. The feeling and
pride of helping people to learn how to code has been great; **my heart will
always have this warm feeling about my time there**.

At the time of writing I am still unsure what to do, there are some amazing
offers on the table, some crazy ideas and a ton of uncertainty. My decision 
at the moment is not to decide on anything. I am spending the month of
December in a sort-of-sabbatical where I will try not to think about anything
concrete (_this is proving difficult as my brain is finding idea after idea
at the moment_).

I am in that figurative crossroads looking into the different paths thinking
to myself: _"Which one of these has dragons and which one will lead me a 
little closer to mastery?"_

If you have any idea of what I should do, let me know, I am all ears for any
proposal (_not deciding yet though_).

Oh, one last thing, regardless of the decision I have created a newsletter:
**[Enrique's week in a bottle](https://tinyletter.com/ecomba)** (_you can
also find a link on the sidebar_).
