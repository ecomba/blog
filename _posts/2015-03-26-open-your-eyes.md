Zombies walk our streets day in and day out. People with their heads buried in their mobile phones, day dreaming or simply just sleeping whilst they are walking to work.

It shocks me every time when I come to this realisation as I dodge people on the streetsâ€¦

You are not aware of your surroundings, you live inside your on shell disregarding anyone and everyone.

If everyone would try to be a little more aware and try not to step on every others toes (_figuratively and not so figuratively_) everything would be so much better for all.

**Human, please be HUMAN!**
