When you start a new venture, you dream of the times when work is abundant and you reap what you have sowed.

To get there, though, requires an incredible push and work (_unless you are one of the lucky ones who've found something so easy to attract customers, which hardly requires any work_). During this time, we often forget ourselves and put our health at peril. I should know about this; I do it all the time.

Last month I put my gym membership on hold to spend more time working on our product at [Bean Mind](https://beanmind.com). The product has enjoyed a significant push towards our MVP, but the cost has been quite steep. I feel less energised and need more breaks during the day. The good news is that I was reminded how important it is to get my work-life imbalance straight.

It's important not to forget that without good health, we wouldn't be able to accomplish so many dreams we would love to.

Not everything is lost; this past month has taught me to get on with it, go to the gym, and work smarter! 💪🏽
