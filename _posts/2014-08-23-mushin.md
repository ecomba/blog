Yesterday we had a wonderful _Talks Night (tm)_ at [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com)! If you haven't ever been to a **Makers Academy Talks Night** you definitely should (_just costs you about £8000 to participate... this was a joke_)!

In a **Makers Academy Talks Night** you will learn a lot of things that you possibly didn't know about, like how to produce music, how to save money by batch-cooking, Venezuela, Singapore, women in tech, ... **you name it** It is a really great evening and the kudos really go to all the students, but specially to those who had the courage to stand in front of everyone giving a talk!

I wanted to write a little about this concept, I have been talking about a little for the last five years or so, as I gave a talk about it during our **Makers Academy Talks Night** yesterday; **Mushin no shin**
