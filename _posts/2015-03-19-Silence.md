The city is loud. There is an incessant cacophony all around us; the soundtrack of our metropolitan lives. Some of us cover the sound with yet more sound â€“ silence, **where is it gone?**

_Today when I woke up I decided not to open my eyes at first. I was just letting my senses discover my surroundings. First the sounds of the busy street I live in outside of my bedroom, the warm embrace of my duvet and finally the light shining through the window blind._

I miss the silence, not the total absence of sound, but the sound of nature; far away from the madness of a city.

When was the last time you experienced a whole day of silence?
