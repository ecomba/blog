During a coaching session today my coachee and myself talked about the importance of writing in the context of 
improving ones ability to communicate with your team in a written form.

In a remote world, communicating effectively has become more important than ever. A lot of newly remote companies usually
use _chat_ a lot with tools like [Slack](https://slack.com) amongst others. Chat is a very tempting medium; it creates
the illusion of closeness in a team.

The issue with chat is the ephemeral nature of the medium. It's a great replacement of in person communication in the 
office when we don't want (or can) to jump on a call, but it can also be very distracting when you want to concentrate
on your work.

Problems arise when we want to communicate ideas or request feedback for an issue we are having.

I prefer long form writing to chat. When I have to spend a little more time to clarify my ideas (_in my head and then 
in writing_) I tend to be able to describe much better what I want to say. 
Long form writing, by it's very nature, has a longer shelf life as well (_whereas in chat, conversations get lost in time_).

Do you and your team write long form? If not, why not? What other methods do you use to keep the knowledge of your remote
team?
