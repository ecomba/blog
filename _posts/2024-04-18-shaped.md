This year I started working, mostly as a hobby (_for the moment_) on a product management tool for companies using the
[Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) methodology.

I've been using [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) in a few companies now and I really appreciate how this 
method of working changes the way you think and operate as you work on your product.

It's hard to pinpoint what it really is, it's a sense of calm (and yet there are definite deadlines to be met), the
freedom of choice when building, and generally speaking the maturity it requires from the team you get as you work.

I'm trying to write more about it (_and the building of the product_) on a [separate blog](https://shapeup.work).
If you are interested in following the journey along with me head [over there](https://shapeup.work) or even better, 
[email me](mailto:hello@ecomba.pro)!

At the moment it's still closed to the public, but if you'd be interested to give it a try (_once I think it's ready for it_)
just [hola me](mailto:hello@ecomba.pro).
