Usually I keep _dot_ and configuration files somehow on [github](http://github.com) so that I can retrieve them in case of a mayor disaster ( _laptop blowing up, etc_ ).

The other day I was pairing with a friend. I decided I wanted to share with him my remote pairing configuration... 

**WTF!!! WHERE DID IT GO?!?!?**

Not to long ago my trusted [MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) stopped working and I changed it for a [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com) [MackBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/) ( _a really nice machine if you ask me_ ). Given that I am not working remotely at the moment I didn't have any [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net) or my trusted configurations setup... _a real bummer_

So I quickly installed it and went through it with him, but having learned the lesson, I added it to [my github](http://github.com/ecomba) for future reference.

If you are remotely interested in my [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net) configuration you can take a look at it **[here](http://github.com/ecomba/tmux-conf)**.
