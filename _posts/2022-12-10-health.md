Recently I've been feeling low in physical energy. My mental energy levels are really high
and I am constantly hustling, but I've noticed how my body is not responding the way I would like to.

Afternoon naps (_after lunch_) have become a must and my breaks are more often then they used to be.

This got me a little worried and I decided to get an app to help me measure my health levels a little more accurately and figure out what's going on.
