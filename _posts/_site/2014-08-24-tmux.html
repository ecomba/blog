<p>Usually I keep <em>dot</em> and configuration files somehow on <a href="http://github.com">github</a> so that I can retrieve them in case of a mayor disaster ( <em>laptop blowing up, etc</em> ).</p>

<p>The other day I was pairing with a friend. I decided I wanted to share with him my remote pairing configuration…</p>

<p><strong>WTF!!! WHERE DID IT GO?!?!?</strong></p>

<p>Not to long ago my trusted <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> stopped working and I changed it for a <a href="http://makersacademy.com">Makers Academy</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">MackBook Pro</a> ( <em>a really nice machine if you ask me</em> ). Given that I am not working remotely at the moment I didn’t have any <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net">tmux</a> or my trusted configurations setup… <em>a real bummer</em></p>

<p>So I quickly installed it and went through it with him, but having learned the lesson, I added it to <a href="http://github.com/ecomba">my github</a> for future reference.</p>

<p>If you are remotely interested in my <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net">tmux</a> configuration you can take a look at it <strong><a href="http://github.com/ecomba/tmux-conf">here</a></strong>.</p>
