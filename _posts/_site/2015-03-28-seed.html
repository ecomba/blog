<blockquote>
  <p>Think twice before you speak, because your words and influence 
will plant the seed of either success of failure in the mind
of another</p>

  <p>~ Napoleon Hill</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your mind can be influenced very easily – words we say to others can prime them to fail or do great.</p>

<p><em>It’s quite remarkable how we are wired.</em></p>

<p>Next time you feel a certain way (<em>anxious, amazing, etc</em>) spend some time thinking why that is. Did you or someone else say something that made you feel that way?</p>

<p><strong>There is power in words, use them wisely!</strong></p>
