<p>My son can play video games for 8 hours straight, for possibly a month or longer.</p>

<p>Now as a responsible parent you would not allow that to happen, but that is not really the interesting bit here.</p>

<p>The question you have to ask to yourself is <em>”why is it we can spend 8 hours straight doing something?”</em> – the answer you will soon realise is actually quite simple, <strong>we have fun doing it.</strong></p>

<p>And yet, when it comes to work we end up doing things that we either don’t like or don’t particularly enjoy.</p>

<p>We should aim to create workplaces we really enjoy working in, where everyone has fun and that add to our lives, filling us with energy.</p>

<p><strong>That would be a place even my game playing son would love to work in!</strong></p>
