<p>Laughing and having a good time is known to help in working and getting 
things done better; to be more productive.</p>

<p>This is something I take at heart a lot. I have been called <em>child</em> by some 
very serious developers (serious as in not smiling much) or looked at in 
sheer astonishment with the question <em>“you guys are really working?”</em>.</p>

<p>The way I work best, when my code is the cleanest, when I give the best business advice is when I am having fun. The lightheartedness of my spirit makes me grow and come up with a myriad of ideas and solutions.</p>

<p><strong>How are you at your best?</strong></p>
