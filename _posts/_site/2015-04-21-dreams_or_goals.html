<blockquote>
  <p>Dream as if you’ll live forever. Live as if you’ll die today.</p>

  <p>~ James Dean</p>

<p>There is a difference between dreaming and having a goal.</p>

<p>I dream every day about great deeds and adventures in foreign lands of wonder and magic, places that don’t exist or are buried back in time.</p>

<p>I also dream about things that I don’t really want to do, but I think it would be a great idea if I did – I just don’t want to do these hard enough to put in the effort.</p>

<p>Sometimes though I have a goal – I set a target and I work towards that goal every time I get a chance to do so (<em>depending how eager I am to get there I will spend more time on it</em>).</p>

<p><strong>Next time you <em>want</em> to do something, decide if it’s a dream or a goal, then act based on that decision!</strong></p>
