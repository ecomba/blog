<blockquote>
  <p>The ultimate value of life depends upon awareness and the power of contemplation rather than upon mere survival.</p>

  <p>~ Aristotle</p>

<p>Zombies walk our streets day in and day out. People with their heads buried in their mobile phones, day dreaming or simply just sleeping whilst they are walking to work.</p>

<p>It shocks me every time when I come to this realisation as I dodge people on the streetsâ€¦</p>

<p>You are not aware of your surroundings, you live inside your on shell disregarding anyone and everyone.</p>

<p>If everyone would try to be a little more aware and try not to step on every others toes (<em>figuratively and not so figuratively</em>) everything would be so much better for all.</p>

<p><strong>Human, please be HUMAN!</strong></p>
