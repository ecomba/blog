  <p>It is better to risk starving to death then
surrender. If you give up on your dreams,
 what’s left?</p>

<p>Do you live in a busy city with heavy traffic? Do you know that crossing, difficult to see where the cars come from – high traffic, low visibility.</p>

<p>I’m always amazed how people risk their lives every morning, running over these crossings, risking their lives for a job they don’t even like (<em>they are late!</em>).</p>

<p>And then, when it really matters, when it’s the time you’d have to take those important decisions you just don’t – <em>you are afraid</em></p>

<p>Funnily enough, one of these situations will seriously harm or even kill you, and the other will take to a new journey in life – <strong>choose wisely!</strong></p>
