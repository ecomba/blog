<p>People like the late Steve Jobs where known for their incredible ability to develop a laser sharp focus when it came to work.</p>

<p>Mastery in a skill takes a lifetime of dedication and perfection. You need to practice day in and day out honing the skill.</p>

<p>The problem comes when the skill you practice is the only thing you practice. As a developer you need to hone a whole array of skills ranging from a notion of design, business, marketing, human empathy, etc.</p>

<p>Coding, alas the one you will focus the most in, should not be your only skill.</p>

<p><strong>Your focus should lie on being an all-round better person.</strong></p>
