<p><strong>How do you define success?</strong></p>

<p>Many people think of success in terms of monetary rewards (<em>accumulation
of wealth</em>), others in how wellknown they or their venture is (<em>there are
many other definitions, which I am not going to go into</em>).</p>

<p>None of these definitions ever struck a chord with me.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d like to define successful people as those who get a great satisfaction of
what they do everyday.</p>

<p>Are you there? Do you get that tingling sensation every day before you start?</p>

<p>What can you do to get there? Can I help you?</p>
