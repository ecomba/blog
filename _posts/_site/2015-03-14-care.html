<p>When people talk about what they do in the software development field they talk about <em>best practices, clean code, engineering, etc</em>.</p>

<p>All these things are absolutely great if you think about them, but there is something else, something that we introduced when we started the <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org" title="Software Craftsmanship Movement">Software Craftsmanship movement</a>, <em>care</em>.</p>

<p>When you <em>care</em> about what you do, you not only use the best of your ability as you work, you transmit a little of yourself into your work.</p>

<p>The products, services and software you build become part of what you are, they get imprinted with your <em>DNA</em>.</p>

<p>There are not many people who do work like this, itâ€™s still very rare.</p>

<p><em>Do you <strong>really care</strong> about your work?</em></p>
