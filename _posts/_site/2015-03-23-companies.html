<p>The way we perceive companies from the outside varies. Most look like a thing, a faceless corporation that offers a product or a service – <em>a tribe</em>.</p>

<p>How the company is perceived within; that’s a more interesting question.</p>

<p>Sadly I see a lot of places in where people are completely disengaged by their work or company. They are there because it pays the bills.</p>

<p>In other companies there is the will to do meaningful work, but somehow “<em>the company</em>” is making it hard.</p>

<p>Either way, that concept of a company, in the smaller scale, is obsolete.</p>

<p><strong>You should strive to work in a place that gives your work meaning, a place where you can express yourself!</strong></p>
