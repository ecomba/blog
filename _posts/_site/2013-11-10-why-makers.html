<p>I have been asked a couple of times now why I teach at <a href="http://makersacademy.com">Makers Academy</a> instead of making <em>a lot of money</em> with my skills.</p>

<p>I could write about many reasons that this is so; <a href="http://twitter.com/shadchnev">being</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/startuprob">part</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/JordanPoulton">of</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/alexpeattie">an</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/anitacanita">awesome</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenkostucki">team</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/Jamedjo">helps</a>, but that is not the main reason.</p>

<p>Last friday, at the <a href="http://alumni.makersacademy.com/cohorts/august">graduation</a>, magic happened while having an inocent conversation with the mother of one of our graduates; a humbling moment; a compliment; an inspiring gesture.</p>

<p>There are many different reasons that make teaching a fullfilling calling, but that conversation trumped everything so far:</p>

  <p>In 12 weeks you have achieved what I, as a mother, havenâ€™t in a lifetime; thank you!
