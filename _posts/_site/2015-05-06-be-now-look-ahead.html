<blockquote>
  <p>We travel together, passengers on a little spaceship, 
dependent on it’s vulnerable reserves of air and soil, all 
committed, for our safety, to it’s security and peace. 
Preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work and 
the love we give our fragile craft.</p>

  <p>~ Adlai E. Stevenson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes in life we are afraid of our next step, afraid to commit, afraid of our own shadow. We get anxious about the overwhelming amounts of what if’s and maybes.</p>

<p>Our minds get clouded and troubled in this busy times; it’s very easy to fall into the maelstrom of thoughts.</p>

<p>Take a breath, calm down, let the pressure fall. You are capable of doing many things in life, in fact, you have the potential to do everything you want to do.</p>

<p>Look ahead, to your desired future, and <strong>be now</strong> – <em>you will get there!</em></p>
