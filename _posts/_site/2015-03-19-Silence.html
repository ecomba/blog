  <p>In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.</p>

  <p>~ Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>

<p>The city is loud. There is an incessant cacophony all around us; the soundtrack of our metropolitan lives. Some of us cover the sound with yet more sound â€“ silence, <strong>where is it gone?</strong></p>

<p><em>Today when I woke up I decided not to open my eyes at first. I was just letting my senses discover my surroundings. First the sounds of the busy street I live in outside of my bedroom, the warm embrace of my duvet and finally the light shining through the window blind.</em></p>

<p>I miss the silence, not the total absence of sound, but the sound of nature; far away from the madness of a city.</p>

<p>When was the last time you experienced a whole day of silence?</p>
