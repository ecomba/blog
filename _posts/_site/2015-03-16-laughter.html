  <p>Laughter is the sun that drives the winter from the human face.</p>

<p>When was the last time you laughed at work? The last time you felt you are having a really good time as you work through your tasks?</p>

<p>It’s surprising how many people struggle to find joy whilst working. Yes, sometimes we do things we do not like, work at jobs that we’d rather not do.</p>

<p>I still challenge you, even if you don’t like what you are currently doing, to find a little joy in it.</p>
