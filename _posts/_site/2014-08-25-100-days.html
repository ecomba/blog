<p>So my friend <a href="http://roidriscoll.github.io">Roi</a> and me have started this thing… a <a href="http://roidriscoll.github.io/blog/2014/08/25/100-days/">100 days</a> of creating content, or rather a 100 days of pushing code to <a href="http://github.com">github</a>.</p>

<p>Coding is a passion of mine, but recently I have been working mostly on private projects and repos, which is great, but we want to produce things that are useful for people as well.</p>

<p>There are a ton of projects and ideas that one can build to help, and I am going to start working on some.</p>

<p>I am thinking about a blogging engine that I thought about a while ago, but never got to work on as I somehow had the idea of it being a commercial product ( <em>also I wanted to use it myself for blogging, maybe I will, maybe I will just create it and let others do it</em> ). This might be a good starting project, I will see. <strong>The important part is working on something, <em>many different things</em>, to create the habit</strong>.</p>

<p>Wish us luck and, <strong>hey</strong> if you have an idea that you don’t mind to be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source project</a>, just let us know!</p>
