<blockquote>
  <p>Trust is the glue of life. It’s the most essential ingredient
in effective communication. It’s the foundational principle
that holds all relationships.</p>

  <p>~ Stephen Covey</p>

<p><strong>Do you trust the people you work with?</strong></p>

<p>Don’t just go and and answer <em>”yes”</em>. Think about it first. And besides, no one is going to hear your answer anyways.</p>

<p>What does it mean to <strong>really</strong> trust someone?</p>

<p>They are the people you know that will do anything in their hands to help you with whatever problem you have; they are rare.</p>

<p>In the work environment you will possibly not achieve this level of trust I am talking about, but you will definitely know if you don’t trust someone.</p>

<p>If you don’t trust the people you work with find someone you do trust – you will enjoy work and your life far more.</p>

<p><strong>Trust me on that!</strong></p>
