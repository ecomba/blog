<p>A lot of people say they are afraid of doing that thing they really would love doing. They dream about that life that could be, but never seem to be able to get the courage to do so.</p>

<p>Thing is, this is not fear. Fear comes from comes from an imminent threat or danger.</p>

<p>Anxiety happens when instead of doing something we <em>think</em> about possible (<em>bad</em>) outcomes of the thing we want to do.</p>

<p>One thing that a few know though is that your anxiety is a compass you can use to know what you should be doing. Your resistance tries to keep you away from doing things that threaten your inner status quo.</p>

<p><strong>Fight your anxieties and face your dreams!</strong></p>
