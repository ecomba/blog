<blockquote>
  <p>Life is either a great adventure or nothing</p>

  <p>~ Helen Keller</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you look at the world with the eyes of an adventurer every hurdle seems like a challenge, a game you need to beat, an obstacle you can, and have to surpass.</p>

<p>Live your life like an adventurer, drawing your own map as you move in through the vast mountains and valleys seeking to satisfy your thirst for <strong>adventure!</strong></p>
