<p>You read that right. Surprised? Challenged?</p>

<p>I hear those words a lot from people not involved in helping people to learn how to code. It seems, to them, that what we are doing is something that cannot be accomplished; the human brain appears (<em>to them again</em>) not to be capable of processing the sheer amount of information needed to become a developer.</p>

<p>Having done this now for some while I could not disagree more with the title of this blogpost.</p>

<p>I have seen people developing skills that they did not have before on a weekly basis. Makers that only used their computers to entertain themselves suddenly are capable, within a few weeks (<em>three to be exact</em>) to develop a domain model with objects interacting with each other, <strong>TEST FIRST!</strong></p>

<p>In fact, in the second week of learning how to code, I see people solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)">coding katas</a> (<em>like the <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataFizzBuzz">FizzBuzz</a> or the <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRomanNumerals">Roman Numerals</a> katas</em>).</p>

<p>The human brain is capable of absorbing and processing huge amounts of information, we do that every day.</p>

<p><strong>Our challenge</strong>: <em>finding and perfecting ways to tap into that potential in order to unleash the full learning capacity of the human brain</em>.</p>
