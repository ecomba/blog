<p>So <a href="/2014/08/25/100-days/">yesterday I announced</a> the idea <a href="http://roidriscoll.github.io">Roi</a> and me had about committing every day to <a href="http://github.com">github</a>.</p>

<p>Today I set up a new project, <a href="https://github.com/ecomba/chronicler">chronicler</a> to start working on it for some time.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ecomba/chronicler">Chronicler</a> is a blogging service that will focus on the content creation and ease of use. I want non-technical bloggers not to have to worry about anything but their content.</p>

<p>The code will be open source, but I will add a service as well for those who don’t want to deal with the technicalities of setting a chronicler instance up ( <em>big words… I haven’t even really started with the project and I am talking about these things already</em> ).</p>

<p>Wish me luck with it and if you like the idea ( <em>once you see a little more of code in the project repo</em> ) maybe you can chip in and help?</p>
