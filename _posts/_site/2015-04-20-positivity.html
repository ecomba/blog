<p>I bet you know someone who is always positive, never in a bad mood, eternal Pan Am smile on their face.</p>

<p><strong><em>Some people are just way to positive, arenâ€™t they?</em></strong></p>

<p>Being positive, or having a good mood, is a decision you take every morning by and for yourself. When you wake up you decide to have a good or a bad day.</p>

<p>The environment that surrounds you has a huge impact on how you are going to feel. Surround yourself with bad news and you will inevitably be sucked into it.</p>

<p>So, for today, and the rest of the week if you dare, surround yourself by people that are nice to you, get inspired and smile a little more (<em>the sun is shining after all</em>)!</p>
