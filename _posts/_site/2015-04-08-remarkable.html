<blockquote>
  <p>The remarkable thing is, we have a choice
everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace
for that day.</p>

  <p>~ Charles R. Swindoll</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be remarkable you donâ€™t have to do things that change humanity, things that everyone will talk about.</p>

<p><em>The real secret to becoming remarkable it to give your entire self to everything you do. Be present at what you do, do things that you could not have done any better.</em></p>
