title: Breaking the chain

> Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains

There are chains in our society, in the pressure of living in a society. Some of them can be broken with courage and determination, some are harder to go through.

Breaking free of chains requires courage. The smallest chain, made of the weakest material can seem daunting at first. What is an impossible task at first might be really easy to master once you can see past your own anxiety.

**Your chains can be broken â€“ _only if you will_!**
