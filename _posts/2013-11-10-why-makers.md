title: Why I teach at Makers Academy
---
I have been asked a couple of times now why I teach at [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com) instead of making *a lot of money* with my skills.

I could write about many reasons that this is so; [being](http://twitter.com/shadchnev) [part](http://twitter.com/startuprob) [of](http://twitter.com/JordanPoulton) [an](http://twitter.com/alexpeattie) [awesome](http://twitter.com/anitacanita) [team](http://twitter.com/rubenkostucki) [helps](http://twitter.com/Jamedjo), but that is not the main reason.

Last friday, at the [graduation](http://alumni.makersacademy.com/cohorts/august), magic happened while having an inocent conversation with the mother of one of our graduates; a humbling moment; a compliment; an inspiring gesture.

There are many different reasons that make teaching a fullfilling calling, but that conversation trumped everything so far:

> In 12 weeks you have achieved what I, as a mother, haven't in a lifetime; thank you!
> ~ mom
