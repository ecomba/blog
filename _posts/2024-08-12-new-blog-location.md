You might have noticed, or you might have not...

I've been changing things up on my website and I've decided to move my blogging out and into my new platform. I'll leave
this blog untouched (_so we don't lose all the blob posts I've written over time_). 

**From now on I'll be posting here: [https://ecomba.pro/publications/blog](https://ecomba.pro/publications/blog).**

**And as always, have a wonderful day!**
