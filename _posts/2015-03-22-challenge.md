Stepping out of your comfort zone to grow is not an easy thing to do.

[The Resistance][1] will pull hard against every attempt to face a new challenge.

What you need to realise how to use _the resistance_ as a reverse compass. The more you feel repelled by that challenge you have setup to do, the more you should face it and do it.
