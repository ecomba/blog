_I was musing about my coaching engagements and how much energy I draw from them when I see how, through my help, 
teams start performing better than before._

While having a coffee in the morning, a silly thought turned into a complete overhaul of my coaching site, and I 
started to prepare some courses for this coming year.

So, without further ado, let me redirect you to my [coaching site](https://ecomba.pro)!

Look around, and if you see something you like (_or you want to talk to me_), don’t hesitate to 
[book a call](https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/enrique-comba-riepenhausen) over there!
