title: To Care
---

When people talk about what they do in the software development field they talk about _best practices, clean code, engineering, etc_.

All these things are absolutely great if you think about them, but there is something else, something that we introduced when we started the [Software Craftsmanship movement][1], _care_.

When you _care_ about what you do, you not only use the best of your ability as you work, you transmit a little of yourself into your work.

The products, services and software you build become part of what you are, they get imprinted with your _DNA_.

There are not many people who do work like this, itâ€™s still very rare.

_Do you **really care** about your work?_
