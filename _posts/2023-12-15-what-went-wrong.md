Do you remember when you first came into contact with agile software development?

For me, it was somewhat in the late 90’s. I remember that time fondly. We worked in a high-stakes environment, creating software for Germany’s first online insurance company. We were experiencing high pressure, and the stakes for our clients for such a disruptive product were even higher.

As one of the technical leads in our team, I was feeling the pressure; it was almost unbearable; something had to change.

That’s when I came across the [c2 wiki](http://c2.com). I spent so much time absorbing the knowledge embedded in those pages; it changed me.

Agile has always meant to be a change in your inner values, a joyful way of working, and ultimately focusing primarily on shipping software that matters.

Over the last decade(s), there has been a tendency to focus on rituals and team topology practices, which, if dissected, don’t add to the company’s bottom line in any meaningful way.

Are you overcomplicating your processes and teams? Is your software being shipped consistently?
