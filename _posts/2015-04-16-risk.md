Do you live in a busy city with heavy traffic? Do you know that crossing, difficult to see where the cars come from – high traffic, low visibility.

I’m always amazed how people risk their lives every morning, running over these crossings, risking their lives for a job they don’t even like (_they are late!_).

And then, when it really matters, when it’s the time you’d have to take those important decisions you just don’t – _you are afraid_

Funnily enough, one of these situations will seriously harm or even kill you, and the other will take to a new journey in life – **choose wisely!**
