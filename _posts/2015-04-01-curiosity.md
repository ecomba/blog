Do you find yourself, sometimes, reading or researching some seemingly pointless piece of information? Have you ever gone on a limb to find out something more about some random fact that you have overheard?

Or, on the other hand, do you frown upon people who do these kind of things? Do you think these are pointless exercises that are a waste of everyones time?

_Useless knowledge_ helps you to feed your curiosity and your ability to find information just about any topic you can imagine.

If you are a knowledge worker, a problem solver by profession, this is an excellent way to hone your skills; because _useless knowledge_ is not so useless after all.
