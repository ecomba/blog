title: FDD - Fun Driven Development

![](/images/fun.jpg)

Laughing and having a good time is known to help in working and getting 
things done better; to be more productive.

This is something I take at heart a lot. I have been called _child_ by some 
very serious developers (serious as in not smiling much) or looked at in 
sheer astonishment with the question _"you guys are really working?"_.

The way I work best, when my code is the cleanest, when I give the best business advice is when I am having fun. The lightheartedness of my spirit makes me grow and come up with a myriad of ideas and solutions.

**How are you at your best?**
