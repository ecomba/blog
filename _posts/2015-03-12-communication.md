Communicating with other people is sometimes so difficult, there are things
we want to tell them, but we feel that they might take it the _wrong_ way.
So we decide not to speak up, not to tell our team, customer, friend
something that might hurt them.

Inevitably those relations start to suffer as communication breaks down.

The challenges of developing software are mostly unrelated to technology.
Projects, ideas, enterprises rise and fall due to the ability of their people
to communicate with each other, to pursue a common goal and to ultimately
succeed at what they do.

Make an effort and try to communicate with your team, be polite, but do not
leave words unspoken.
