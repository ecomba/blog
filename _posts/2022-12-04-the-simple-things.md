> We all have rosy memories of a simpler, happy time- a time of homemade apple pie and gingham curtains, a time when Mom understood everything and Dad could fix anything. "Let's get those traditional family values back!" we murmur to each other. Meanwhile, in a simultaneous universe, everyone I know, and every celebrity I don't know, is coming out of the closet to talk about how miserable they are because they grew up in dysfunctional families.

Since I was a little boy, I've been surrounded by technology, it all started when I was ten years old, and I got my first computer. It was a [old machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_32/64) without any games, so I was forced to learn how to program. I soon became enamoured with technology and programming languages; I was fascinated by the worlds and possibilities I suddenly had at my fingertips.

Over time though, I lost my drive to program, _just for programming's sake_ and always looked for meaning: _"Why are we doing this?", "What's the purpose of this application?", "Who will it help?"_.

I love baking bread, cooking jam and marmalade, and preparing dishes with fresh ingredients daily. 

My home is a mixture of new and old, juxtaposing times, and I would not have it any other way.
