I had a lovely catch-up with an old friend and fellow coach yesterday. We shared our life stories and what we’ve been up to up until now.

**Inevitably, we talked about our work as coaches.**

One thing that stood out for me is how there is a belief, in some communities and companies, that a coach is some tree-hugging, hippy person (_I have in no way or form anything against people focusing on these parts of the human experience_) focusing on intangibles that are way off the business’s primary focus.

Coaching a business, a team, or a person in a working environment has (_or, at the very minimum, should have_) measurable outcomes which will improve some key operating strategy for the company (_what, in detail, depends on the engagement_). Anything else is just a _” feel-good experience”_ for the team (there is value in that too).

**What kind of coach do you need?**

**P.S.**: _If you are currently coaching teams and would like to be coached to become better at what you do, you can always [reach out to me](https://calendly.com/ecomba/free-consultation), and we’ll figure something out_.
