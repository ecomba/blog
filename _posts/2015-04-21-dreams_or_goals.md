There is a difference between dreaming and having a goal.

I dream every day about great deeds and adventures in foreign lands of wonder and magic, places that don’t exist or are buried back in time.

I also dream about things that I don’t really want to do, but I think it would be a great idea if I did – I just don’t want to do these hard enough to put in the effort.

Sometimes though I have a goal – I set a target and I work towards that goal every time I get a chance to do so (_depending how eager I am to get there I will spend more time on it_).

**Next time you _want_ to do something, decide if it’s a dream or a goal, then act based on that decision!**
