I help people, companies and dreamers to achieve their potential.

I co-founded a great software boutique, [patheleven](http://patheleven.com) 

If you have any other questions or just want to drop me a line, please donâ€™t hesitate to do so, I am open to suggestions and ideas!

Currently I work as the Head of Education at Makers Academy helping people change their careers and become great beginners!
